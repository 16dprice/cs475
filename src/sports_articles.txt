washington david freese wasn in the los angeles dodgers starting lineup for game of the nl division series neither was kike hernandez or chris taylor all are right handed batters and all knew that if the washington nationals persisted in their playoff pattern of using starters in relief they might very well be called upon to pinch hit against million lefty patrick corbin so in the first inning sunday night that trio headed to the indoor batting cage that sits near the staircase leading from the visitors dugout to the clubhouse to try to prepare and boy were they prepared when corbin entered so were other dodgers hitters producing postseason inning unlike any other seven runs all scored with two outs and two strikes justin turner three run homer capped startling and record setting rally in the sixth as the dodgers roughed up the starter turned reliever and beat washington to grab lead in their best of five nlds we re just always ready no matter who on the mound righty lefty you ve got to fake it sometimes whether you re ready or not said freese who singled as pinch hitter in the sixth and finished with four hits definitely two strikes you ve got to take it seriously you can assume your ab over freese said you look at the best guys in the game they look like they like two strikes hernandez also entered in that inning and contributed two run double and taylor walked as pinch hitter against corbin russell martin started his first appearance of these playoffs and hit two run double in the sixth as la became the first team in major league history to score seven two out two strike runs in one postseason inning we never doubt ourselves freese said martin who like freese is tacked on two run homer in the ninth this is martin th postseason freese joked it might be his teammate th and freese sixth the dodgers can advance to the nl championship series for the fourth consecutive year by closing the best of five nlds in game at washington on monday when la sends rich hill to the mound against max scherzer and to think things were not looking all that good for the dodgers who entered the sixth trailing after juan soto two run homer off eventual winner hyun jin ryu in the first and max muncy solo shot off washington starter anibal sanchez in the fifth that seemed to wake up la offense well it was either that or the fact that sanchez who struck out nine was gone to begin the sixth in came corbin the lefty who started and lost the opener and hadn made relief appearance since when he only made one just couldn seem to get that third out there corbin said just stinks it continued nationals manager dave martinez postseason penchant for pushing his starters to appear in relief deemed necessary because of his club nl worst bullpen the strategy had been working needless to say not this time against the dodgers who lost in the world series each of the past two years and led the nl with wins this season more than the nationals anibal was at pitches he gave us all he had we were at good spot in the lineup where we thought corbin could get through it martinez said and his stuff was good but he had every hitter he just couldn finish after cody bellinger snapped his for start to the series with single he would add double later in the inning corbin struck out the next two hitters that when it all fell apart for washington freese the mvp of the nlcs and world series for st louis singled to put runners on the corners he has to be going down as one of the greatest october players of all time muncy said don care what anyone says he has to be martin came through on slider that landed on the warning track in left center putting the visitors ahead hernandez connected on slider for yet another two run double to left center hit off the base off the wall after muncy was intentionally walked wander suero entered and promptly served up full count fastball that turner lofted to the back of the visiting bullpen beyond left field making it couple guys came up and had really big at bats and that what we ve been doing all year muncy said that was one of those things where once one guy started doing it the next cat picked up on it and it just kind of rolled throughout the inning what relief with baseball era leader this season ryu done after going five innings and allowing two runs dodgers manager dave roberts pieced together the remaining outs with five relievers that included closer kenley jansen who hadn pitched in game since sept he threw ninth that included pair of strikeouts trainer room nationals cf victor robles was out of the lineup with strained right hamstring after getting hurt running to first base in game michael taylor started in robles place and went for up next three time cy young award winner scherzer was pushed back from game to game scherzer entered these playoffs with his teams having lost his most recent seven postseason appearances but washington is when he pitches so far this october including start in the nl wild card game against milwaukee and one inning three strikeout relief appearance in game at los angeles that bullpen use led the nationals to switch scherzer start from sunday to monday he can beat you in the strike zone with three pitches he can beat you out of the zone roberts said he relentless hill went with era this season in just starts he spent time on the il with sprained right knee and strained left forearm activated for the last time less than month ago hill hasn pitched more than three innings in an appearance since june pitch count whatever it is can control that the year old

ashburn va owner dan snyder and president bruce allen summoned coach jay gruden to the washington redskins facility before dawn monday to tell him he was being fired it was brief conversation allen said now comes longer conversation about the status of the floundering franchise that has won just two playoff games in snyder two decades of ownership and zero during allen tenure gruden is out after an start to his sixth season and is the latest in long line of redskins coaches to take the fall for significant organizational shortcomings to make decision like this is difficult but it was necessary allen said during minute news conference our start is not just disappointing we had much different expectations for the beginning of the season we owe it to our fans the organization the players the coaches and their families to do everything we can to win the redskins haven won much lately going overall under gruden with one playoff appearance in the season popular coach among players and smart offensive mind gruden struggled in preparing his teams washington went in season openers and lost win and get in game in week in against the new york giants who had nothing to play for despite never before being head coach in the nfl and despite never winning more than nine games in season gruden managed to stick around longer than anyone else who held that job during snyder unsuccessful stint as owner asked why snyder wasn addressing fans allen said because am snyder was not made available to reporters monday none of the six coaches hired since snyder bought the team has winning record including hall of famer joe gibbs and two time super bowl champion mike shanahan offensive line coach bill callahan becomes the seventh after he was selected to replace gruden on an interim basis callahan has coached the raiders in the nfl and nebraska in college football this is different territory for me callahan said it bittersweet in lot of ways had to replace veteran coach in jay and then to be asked to lead program now in week it uncharted waters for me this season alone has seen star left tackle trent williams hold out shuffle at quarterback after dwayne haskins was taken no overall in the draft series of injuries up and down the roster and perhaps most upsetting to team leadership increasingly large contingents of visiting fans attending games at washington home stadium all we can do is try to improve our product allen said these games we weren close in we ve lost five games and we didn lose them in the last second we lost these games decisively and we have to change that allen is right the redskins rarely have even been competitive ranking th out of nfl clubs in scoring averaging points and defense allowing points per game the only club that ranks worse than washington in both categories the miami dolphins will host the redskins next sunday cornerback quinton dunbar wrote on instagram that he owes gruden for life for helping him by switching him from wide receiver after college and added sorry we couldn get the job done for you gruden was fired the morning after loss to the defending champion new england patriots afterward gruden said he didn have concern about his job status with season remaining on his contract nobody told me anything gruden said if my key works on monday keep working instead gruden is gone and allen was asked repeatedly about his own job performance the redskins are with allen working in some capacity since allen said he doesn believe anybody is hiding from their record and took issue with questions about the organizational culture that has been the subject of widespread criticism you know the culture is actually damn good allen said these people care we have very young core of players that we have brought in here who are accustomed to winning if you look at the record of these guys they re accustomed to winning they want to win what working the brutal start to the redskins schedule is over and the even more hapless dolphins are up next what needs help everything on defense needs to be better but callahan said he won make any changes to his coaching staff including defensive coordinator greg manusky stock up adrian peterson better be ready to run callahan expressed desire to commit to the running game so an old school ground game is coming stock down haskins could be inactive as washington third quarterback sunday at miami with callahan saying the ohio state product will get his chance at some point injured tight end jordan reed remains out with concussion donald penn williams replacement at left tackle injured hamstring in the patriots game key number the redskins rushing attempts are the third fewest in the nfl next steps callahan will pick starting quarterback between case keenum and

the nfl biggest trend so far in is well setting trends in its th season highlighted by all sorts of celebrations and honor what has become the nation most popular sport those trends tend to skew toward the negative side because this is supposed to be an uplifting season it worthwhile to take note of some of the more pleasant developments before examining those that have marred the first five weeks of the schedule for example the success of road teams is positive consider that the packers seahawks ravens and eagles have fallen at home the broncos are with mile high migraine in denver those are difficult places to play yet away teams are not counting sunday game in london allegedly home match for the raiders the chiefs patriots and bills already are as road teams as bill parcells frequently said while still coaching if you go on the road you should make the playoffs this trend actually might have begun last january when both conference title games were won albeit laden with controversy by the visitors the rams at new orleans the patriots at kansas city watching some high profile clubs and their stars soar early on is an upbeat trend so are the comebacks into the spotlight of teddy bridgewater watt and robert quinn but it far too easy to get inundated by the bad vibes created by damaging or unconstructive occurrences it can be argued that still the most mentioned name in pro football is someone out of the nfl antonio brown not only did the star wide receiver embarrass himself in three cities by forcing his way out of pittsburgh and oakland then getting cut by new england franchise that takes chance on virtually everyone brown also joined the parade of standout players set in motion by odell beckham jr of players poisoning their relationships with team to force trade elsewhere jadeveon clowney got his transfer out of houston jalen ramsey is playing that disturbing game now with the jaguars also disturbing is seeing so many empty seats in places such as washington cincinnati and all three florida nfl stadiums it only early october and using weather as an excuse is lame and inaccurate try mediocre of worse teams including one in miami that might not beat the nearby hurricanes as the cause maybe one of the things turning off those fans and this is valid is the proliferation of yellow flags so few games have any flow because of all the penalties and it dangerous development an emphasis on penalizing holding early in september so disrupted games that it made baseball seem fast paced in comparison that emphasis appears to have dissipated though there still are plenty of officials flags flying for that violation blaming the lack of on field work for regulars in the preseason was acceptable for few weeks but no longer and what about the perception that on field officials and the officiating office in new york won overturn an interference call on replay review when coach makes challenge as he is now allowed to do under trial rule adjustment resulting from the egregious non call in the nfc title game does the league or at the least those officials with whistles actually despise the rule so much that because interference is judgment call they simply won allow challenge to succeed perhaps the most worrisome trend in has been the epidemic of injuries to starting quarterbacks while some previous no qbs have been benched for poor performances consider that drew brees and ben roethlisberger likely hall of famers are on the sideline so are nick foles cam newton case keenum mitchell trubisky and sam darnold who should return from mononucleosis sometime this month on sunday roethlisberger backup mason rudolph took terrifying hit that knocked him out cold and caused concussion the jets also are down to their third stringer after trevor siemian went down in week with severe ankle injury not to leave bad taste in fans mouths about the nfl whose ratings are up amount of money gambled remains stratospheric and whose fantasy football attractiveness is through the roof consider that there tremendous battle for the no overall pick in next april draft folks of the bengals dolphins jets and redskins are considering any win in that race tantamount to elimination from it more ap nfl https apnews com nfl and https twitter com ap nfl copyright by the associated press this story is from espn com automated news wire wire index recommend tweet email subscribe print comments

kansas city mo the way indianapolis handled the kansas city chiefs on sunday night sent jolt through the nfl whether it was dominating the line of scrimmage or shutting down patrick mahomes and co on defense the one place the shock didn reverberate the visiting locker room in arrowhead stadium the one emotion we were not feeling is shock can even explain it colts coach frank reich said after the victory the way guys were walking down the hallway it was we re not going to be denied we have to get on track we ve got to do it just knew it was real felt it all week there was just an air of confidence and belief that we would do what we did today marlon mack ran for yards and ageless kicker adam vinatieri knocked through four field goals as the colts atoned ever so slightly for january playoff defeat inside the same stadium asked what the message was pregame longtime chiefs linebacker turned colts defensive end justin houston replied to come out here and play our game to leave it out there every snap to play with your heart play with your soul and think we did that tonight the colts allowed points on the chiefs first two possessions before shutting them out until harrison butker field goal with to go indianapolis recovered the onside kick without any issue and ran out the clock to celebrate big win heading into its bye mahomes threw for yards and touchdown and the chiefs had just yards rushing despite getting top running back damien williams back from an injury all while watching their record streak of straight games scoring at least points come to crashing conclusion penalties are really what hurt us today said chiefs coach andy reid whose team was flagged times for yards you get things going all of sudden you re going backward and it tough in this league to do that against good team and win in an air it out era of the nfl the colts also won by dominating the line of scrimmage on offense their big line bruised kansas city defensive front that lost chris jones and xavier williams to injuries that created big holes for mack and plenty of time for jacoby brissett who threw for yards while running for the colts only touchdown on defense the colts spent most of the night in the kansas city backfield plugging up holes in the running game and relentlessly pressuring the reigning league mvp on passing downs mahomes was sacked four times and hit plenty more at one point in the second half cam erving was pushed so far into mahomes face that the backup left tackle stepped on his quarterback ankle leaving mahomes to hobble to the sideline when kansas city was forced to punt in this league the margin of error is tiny said mahomes who dismissed the seriousness of his injury if you re not executing at high level you re going to lose the colts and chiefs mostly played to first half stalemate but the second of vinatieri four field goals made it at the break the real winners were the officials who finally got to rest the arms that they used to throw flags for the first minutes the chiefs prolific offense continued to sputter in the second half and brissett and the colts essentially played game of keep away throughout the third quarter and into the fourth you don need large playbook to convert third and chiefs defensive end frank clark said the colts used off the clock to move mere yards and set up vinatieri next field goal then when the chiefs failed to convert fourth and at their own indianapolis got another field goal from vinatieri with to go to make it two possession game you could just tell they were hungry they were hungry all week reich said know that not uncommon but there was something different about this week could feel it it was palpable we just walked in here with lot of confidence last night in our meetings can even explain what happened in our meetings last night there was just feeling amongst the team when we walked into this stadium almost int mahomes nearly threw his first interception of the season in the third quarter when fb anthony sherman batted pass and lb bobby okereke caught it review showed the ball bounced off the ground ring of honor the chiefs inducted ol brian waters into their hall of fame during halftime waters was two time all pro for kansas city before wrapping his year career with the patriots and cowboys happy returns colts de justin houston celebrated his first trip to kansas city as visitor by sacking mahomes in the first half the four time pro bowl pick had sacks during eight seasons with the chiefs flag day chiefs cb bashaud breeland had night to forget not only did he struggle in pass coverage he was flagged four times for yards that included yard pass interference call injuries colts cbs shak taylor chest and kenny moore ii knee left in the first
