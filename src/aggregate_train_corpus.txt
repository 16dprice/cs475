once upon time don worry we ll get to that one real quick throne of eldraine is almost here we re eating food and going on adventures and meeting all sorts of interesting fairy tale inspired friends and apart from the exciting flavor there bunch of power in the set waiting to be released on the standard format with four sets also leaving standard this is one of the biggest standard shakeups in long time meaning throne of eldraine is likely to make huge impact so without further ado here are my loves and hates for throne of eldraine hate once upon time where better to start don worry despite what the internet may be telling you every game of magic until the end of time in every format isn going to start with the words cast once upon time yes once upon time is free spell and yes free spells tend to be problematic however this is not just free ancient stirrings once upon time costs two mana which is what you re going to be paying for the card the majority of the time it also only finds creatures or lands further limiting its usage so we need to be playing green deck with good amount of creatures that doesn mind drawing random impulse over the course of game typically creature heavy decks tend to be aggressive or tempo based meaning spending two mana to not affect the board is death knell think about what tempo black hole card like discovery dispersal is so that the bad part what about the payoff when it actually in our opening hand we get to cast commune with dinosaurs off of our turn one temple of malady that it sure commune with dinosaurs is great and early game cantrips help to sculpt your gameplan and make your deck more consistent but at the cost of putting what essentially leyline into your deck and there the rub once upon time has more in common with leyline of void than ancient stirrings for some broken modern or legacy decks that are intensely interested in their opening hands and not much more sure once upon time is reasonable option for fair green decks in standard that are slow enough to not mind casting an impulse sure but the default thought on this card is going to be does my deck want this card not playing green so playing four once upon time once upon time will see play but the hype around this card is astoundingly overblown love murderous rider there really not much to say here the adventure cards are pure card advantage and swift end would have been playable if it was just instant with no extra text hero downfall was format defining card when it was last legal and two life is paltry price to pay for hero downfall that always cantrips into spell sure lifelink knight isn the best creature of all time for three mana but it literally just free bonus on top of your hero downfall furthermore if you re playing matchup where you don need removal spells is far better than dead card murderous rider is one of the best cards in the set for standard play however good you think it is promise you it is better love bonecrusher giant it little weaker on the front side and stronger on the back side but everything said about murderous rider applies to bonecrusher giant as well kill creature take your card advantage and then cast creature that may have been playable even without the adventure side while shock is certainly weaker than hero downfall you can also look at it as bonecrusher giant having sort of pseudo haste as the shock can always go upstairs when there are no good targets again one of the best cards in the set even if you like it you re probably underrating bonecrusher giant love savvy hunter okay let talk food in some ways food is similar to energy from kaladesh in that it somewhat parasitic cards that make food or care about food are mostly only going to work with other cards that make and care about food it certainly better design than energy because you can interact with the food tokens and they can do other things like trigger artifact or sacrifice synergies but for the most part food cards are going to want to stick together making food can be too difficult and there has to be something very good to do with your food how about drawing cards is that good savvy hunter is food tireless tracker so far looking like the best reason to want food tokens in your deck its body is already respectable and it can help with food creation as well but it going to get turbo charged once you start adding other food cards to the mix oko thief of crowns looks very good with savvy hunter in play while gilded goose helps to cast either card on turn two while also providing great enabler and payoff for food synergies but make no mistake if there food deck savvy hunter will be the most important card in the deck love slaying fire here real easy one mono red aggro is always deck slaying fire is essentially better flame javelin flame javelin was format defining card for mono red when it was legal in standard slaying fire will be too that it hate questing beast haven we heard this song before questing beast is cut from the same cloth as other green mythics like nullhide ferox it big it green and it has lot of words on it so many words that it evokes feeling of how could they print this however like nullhide ferox questing beast will see some play but not be anything close to what it hyped to be right now yes haste is very good yes it can be chump blocked by tokens and random small creatures yes vigilance and deathtouch are nice additions however that mostly it the planeswalker redirection text is nice touch but if you re in position to kill their planeswalker with your haste creature you re already in good spot regardless questing beast doesn help you get out of the bad spot where you can get through nor does it provide much aid when your opponent has good board presence and that the crux of questing beast it just medium sized idiot it still dies to removal spells it still can get stalled on gummed up board it still trades with other midsized creatures for no benefit it has no relevant creature types or synergies and it in the awkward spot at four mana of being bit too big for aggressive decks and bit underwhelming for midrange decks it also legendary which can be significant deck building constraint questing beast will certainly see play across it time in standard but its bark is much mightier than its bite love acclaimed contender there lot of tribal support for knights in throne of eldraine but tribal decks often need more than just good attackers and blockers enter acclaimed contender if knights is going to be successful deck in throne of eldraine standard it will be on the back of acclaimed contender sort of militia bugler goblin ringleader hybrid card acclaimed contender provides card advantage and board presence all together in one neat easy to cast package tribally relevant body is no joke and acclaimed commander is not only always going to find you spell but it likely to be good one knight decks will clearly be full of other knights but there are also some sub synergies between knights and equipment that acclaimed contender helps to bring together as well acclaimed contender is the truth love smitten swordmaster while we re on the subject we may as well ride the knight train horse for minute smitten swordmaster is secretly one of the best knight payoffs in the set adventure cards are easy to undervalue as whole because they re so different than what we ve seen before but this is essentially decent drop creature that also has one mana lightning helix or better built in to it reach is always an important thing for aggressive decks to have and being able to adventure smitten swordmaster on turn four or five for ten point life drain and then also play it as creature immediately is quite powerful child of night isn that far below the bar and the adventure potential here is huge it also awesome to bring it back with order of midnight so you can use it again love wintermoor commander while the official knight lord inspiring veteran is most of the good knight cards seem concentrated in wintermoor commander is another powerful knight that is more than the sum of its parts high toughness deathtouch creatures are phenomenal and wintermoor commander makes blocking hell for your opponent in any sort of creature based matchup wintermoor commander is going to be awesome and if your opponent has lot of removal it is going to die just like inspiring veteran would so there not much difference there either knights is looking better and better to take over the mantle from vampires as standard tribal aggro deck of choice hate the great henge want to like this card really do making mana drawing cards gaining life love all of these things but the upfront cost is just too high even with power creature in play this still costs five mana which is going to come down as probably one of the last cards in your hand the great henge has the vanquisher banner problem of just being too expensive and not effecting the board enough to be an engine we re trained by ghalta primal hunger to think this will count the total power of all of our creatures which would be much better but that is not the case also ghalta was perfect last card to play because it was big and game ending curve topper the great henge needs more creatures in hand to make great hope wrong but this one probably best suited for commander love shimmer dragon speaking of commander you may be asking yourself what the hell is shimmer dragon don see this one in the set well you be correct shimmer dragon is not in throne of eldraine proper but rather in the brawl decks that are complementary product to the set however surprise while shimmer dragon is not in booster backs it is fully legal in standard and for all intents and purposes real magic card and you know what shimmer dragon is really powerful there already good precedent for large hexproof fliers being good and shimmer dragon goes beyond that to provide card draw engine too this is all of course contingent on having good number of artifacts in play but if your deck meets the criteria then shimmer dragon is phenomenal top end card shimmer dragon may not make an impact immediately but there is serious potential here if there blue deck interested in playing lot of artifacts love faeburrow elder when evaluating new cards it always important to look at the floor of card as well as the ceiling because what cards fail state is will usually define its playability well palladium myr with vigilance is quite the fail state and faeburrow elder threatens to be quite bit more there no shortage of amazing top end cards to ramp into in standard ranging from six mana planeswalkers to hydroid krasis and friends and faeburrow elder can do some serious damage if you re willing to skew your deck toward it even in three color deck faeburrow elder is going far above and beyond what you normally get for three mana making it very impressive card faeburrow elder with an oath of kaya teferi time raveler or gruul spellbreaker in play is quite the card love fires of invention our last card of the day is perhaps one of the most interesting in lot of ways fires of invention is reminiscent of wilderness reclamation it four mana enchantment that can pay for itself immediately and then give you big mana boost under certain set of restrictions while wilderness reclamation demanded you play instants fires of invention demands big sorcery speed four and five mana cards sound like any midrange decks you know fires of invention is going to pose some pretty interesting deck building questions but as long as you can fuel the fires and have enough things to do with it there huge potential here lot of love think that may have been the highest ever ratio of loves to hates in love hate article that ve done and even the hates we more so based on tempering extreme hype on cards that are playable but not amazing guess that means excited about this set and it good thing to because next week get my first crack at it hark we cordially invite you to watch the mtgeldraine early access streamer event on september pic twitter com qunvxd mi mtg arena mtg_arena september ll be doing my usual ten new standard brews on my stream during the official mtg arena throne of eldraine early access event and then writing about them all in detail next week with grades

it pretty funny now that people were mockingly calling modern horizons commander horizons in an attempt to make fun of wizards of the coast for making modern set with so few playable modern cards in it magic players are notoriously awful at evaluating new cards but even after hogaak arisen necropolis being banned urza lord high artificer crafting an entirely new archetype and wrenn and six completely wrecking legacy there one card whose effect we are going to be feeling for very long time force of negation is one of the most important cards in modern full stop with faithless looting finally banned and graveyard decks no longer putting things into play for free over and over again decks in modern for the most part are actually playing magic again there wide variety of broken things one can do in modern and most them involve casting non creature spells for the ones that want to cast creature spells traditional removal will usually be fine in those spots regardless force of negation puts hard stop to most of the shenanigans that unfair decks can do while also doing so as early as turn one and while allowing you to develop your board it not like we haven seen this before as force of will is the most important card in legacy but force of negation was little hard to use at first because of all the graveyard decks it also wasn entirely clear exactly which decks wanted force of negation but it starting to look like any deck with blue cards in it the most obvious place for force of negation is control decks which have been coming in many varieties azorius control

in modern and it can even tag hate cards like rest in peace we ve been here before soon enough we will realize that force of negation is going to be much closer to force of will than we thought it has many similar features and play patterns while doing lot to help prop up fair decks of all types put simply force of negation must be respected yes it is card disadvantage and you can feel that in fair matchups sometimes but as long as modern is well modern force of negation is going to have serious role however unlike force of will force of negation does have blind spot this means that we can build our decks with force of negation in mind engine cards that are creatures go up in value significantly if your combo piece can be counter by force of negation that great plus card advantage engine creatures like goblin ringleader and tireless tracker also start looking quite nice too whether you plan to beat em or join em if you re going to play modern make sure you understand force of negation role in the new format
it easy to look at decklist that came in st place or made top of major event and think that you ve done your homework for that week event however doing so will only give you small picture of what the format was really like there are often plenty of great decks just end up outside of top that had either slightly worse or even the exact same record as players that made top margins at magic events are very thin and not checking these decks out would be huge leak in your exploration of metagame jacob hagen was on the wrong side of those margins at scg dallas few weeks ago but he had something very interesting brewing jacob took an established but accepted as underpowered archetype black white smallpox and added the format brand new element in stoneforge mystic stoneforge mystic gives the deck an immediate jump in power level and with both batterskull and sword of fire and ice playing so well with what the deck was already doing we ve got something very nice brewing here throw in few copies of the criminally underplayed gideon ally of zendikar and we re off to the races time stamps match match match match match stoneforge pox modern jacob hagen scg dallas th place creatures bloodghast stoneforge mystic planeswalkers gideon ally of zendikar liliana of the veil instants fatal push sorceries thoughtseize inquisition of kozilek lingering souls smallpox artifacts batterskull sword of fire and ice lands plains swamp fetid heath shambling vent godless shrine silent clearing urborg tomb of yawgmoth flagstones of trokair marsh flats sideboard plague engineer ashiok dream render the elderspell kaya orzhov usurper damping sphere collective brutality stony silence fulminator mage damnation buy this deck export text format not too bad despite facing number of matchups that seemed like they be quite difficult on paper we were able to run the tables stoneforge mystic was basically everything the deck could ever want great early threat card that could end the game quickly while our opponents were off balance and card advantage the fear with any disruptive deck is that they ll be able to recover before you can finish them off and stoneforge mystic and gideon ally of zendikar did great job of speeding up the clock speaking of gideon if you re looking for good fair threat that kills fast gideon is an excellent option in modern both stoneforge mystic and gideon pair extremely well with discard spells as you strip away your opponent answers and slow them down then take them out before they can draw what they need when it comes to low resource games gideon and stoneforge are very resource rich if you re looking to play fair in modern or just love smallpox decks give stoneforge pox spin
well whether we agree with it or not faithless looting is no longer part of the modern format so what does that mean for graveyard decks do we throw them all in the garbage what if you already have your dredge deck or your izzet phoenix deck it doesn look like they re going to print careful study anytime soon so where do we turn are there viable replacements for faithless looting in modern well there good news and bad news the bad news is that there really aren great one for one replacements for faithless looting the card was by far the most efficient version of the effect available in the format there was reason it was one of the best cards in the format and why it was banned however don fret there good news too the good news is that with faithless looting gone the graveyard has just become much safer zone to play from without decks like hogaak dredge and izzet phoenix making graveyard removal not only mandatory in sideboards but also sometimes necessary edge in maindecks the graveyard becomes less of an all in proposition this means we don need to be doing something as powerful as hogaak with our graveyard to overcome the trouble of playing around the hate this is because frankly there isn really any hate right now quick look at the results from scg tour dallas last weekend reveals very few graveyard decks and most importantly definitive lack of graveyard hate across most of the top decks from the event so while faithless looting may be gone there far less pressure on your graveyard deck to be amazing because you ll be able to do your thing unimpeded much more often what would you rather play fully powered dredge in world where everyone has four leyline of the void or slightly weaker but still fundamentally powerful dredge deck in world where almost nobody has intense graveyard hate it not about how powerful these decks are in vacuum it about how powerful they are in the current format so let take look at three of the best faithless looting decks from the last year or so and see what we can do dredge perhaps one of the most consistently powerful graveyard decks of the last few years dredge was deck that used every part of the faithless looting buffalo obviously using it to put cards into the graveyard was nice but using the two draws to enable fast dredging once you already had dredge card in the graveyard sped you up considerably and flashback was also super relevant as it allowed you to keep dredging without ever even drawing faithless looting that lot of power and utility to replace however faithless looting isn even the most powerful enabler in dredge while faithless looting was great piece to the puzzle that worked from all angles for cheap cost cathartic reunion is the true powerhouse card in dredge that does literally everything one cathartic reunion and dredge card or two will usually flip almost quarter of your deck in one shot even starting from completely empty graveyard it this amount of speed that gave dredge it most broken openings and we ve still got it the question of course is what do we use to bridge the gap when we don draw cathartic reunion dredge modern jake peralez st place scg dallas modern classic creatures golgari thug bloodghast narcomoeba prized amalgam stinkweed imp sorceries conflagrate cathartic reunion creeping chill life from the loam tome scour artifacts shriekhorn lands

abrupt decay nature claim ancient grudge lightning axe darkblast buy this deck export text format while the main event was devoid of graveyard decks jake peralez would simply swap his faithless looting out for tome scour change few lands and go on to win the sunday modern classic with his slightly modified dredge deck given how little has changed here and how much optimizing there still is to do it not hard to see that dredge is deck that still has legs the problem is that blue sources is not nearly enough to cast tome scour on turn one making it very unreliable would venture that jake won in spite of tome scour his mana base not because of it so alongside tome scour let look at our options there are others but blue offers number of significant mill options that can be turned toward our own library for fun and profit if you were looking to dredge stinkweed imp twice off of faithless looting anyway glimpse the unthinkable does the exact same thing while hedron crab and drowned rusalka provide cheap engines for milling that scale far better into the game than something like shriekhorn these cards have pedigree too dimir dredge extended yuuya watanabe top pro tour austin

alpine moon nature claim lightning axe ancient grudge spell pierce buy this deck export text format we ve maintained the red for cathartic reunion and the green for life from the loam avoiding glimpse the unthinkable for now but it very possible you just want to be dredge is still very powerful and can certainly survive this banning but retooling the deck will be necessary izzet phoenix ah yes izzet phoenix the scourge of modern since my friend and former teammate unleashed arclight phoenix on an unsuspecting modern format this is probably where the faithless looting ban hits hardest as faithless looting was definitely the singular best enabler for arclight phoenix available the deck already wants huge density of one mana cantrips so having cantrip that binned arclight phoenix quickly and easily was large part of what allowed multiple arclight phoenix attacking on turn two or three there are possible replacements but they aren super exciting that basically it seasoned pyromancer doesn jive very well but chart course and izzet charm are both serviceable chart course is much better card to loot with as you maintain card parity while izzet charm flexibility makes it tolerable the reality is that what made izzet phoenix such good deck was not the times it had two arclight phoenix attacking on turn two but the fact that it was really good fair deck that could occasionally do broken things as well thing in the ice and aria of flame are both still awesome magic cards providing very unique and powerful effects for the low cost of playing lot of cantrips in your deck something you re more than happy to do anyway with both cards operating at almost full capacity despite the faithless looting ban we ve still got lot of deck here furthermore while arclight

with lightning axe also helping out to get arclight phoenix into the graveyard for value but there still some serious things happening here that need to be respected mardu pyromancer of course faithless looting had its effect on the fair decks too faithless looting was the backbone of mardu pyromancer giving the non blue deck the ability to manipulate its draw steps while also gaining value of graveyard effects losing that hurts but modern horizons brought some goodies for mardu pyromancer as well to help fill the void seasoned pyromancer steps right in as great graveyard value card that falls perfectly in line with mardu pyromancer gameplan you have plenty of spells you want in the graveyard anyway so seasoned pyromancer does great job of filling the faithless looting role of doing that finding the right cards and making sure you don flood however the card secretly very excited about is ransack the lab yes this is just colorshifted strategic planning card that does not see play in modern but that because blue has an embarrassment of riches in the cantrip department red and black do not ransack the lab can help us find the cards we want provide fuel for bedlam reveler and dump cards like lingering souls and smiting helix in the graveyard as well yes two mana is more than one but mardu pyromancer isn exactly deck known for being fast and our large amount of mana

faithless looting is gone however in weird way this opens up the format to lot of possible graveyard shenanigans don be afraid to experiment as this is very different format than it was few weeks ago we are going to need to realign our perceptions of the format so don be afraid to slay some sacred cows and push those unexpected buttons good luck
near the end of standard format it can be tough to innovate and come up with new decks most cards have been explored and frankly with new set just around the corner acquiring new cards to try things out can be chore so why not look to put sweet twist onto an existing archetype perhaps can interest you in one sided armageddon ashiok dream render is already reasonable card in standard as the anti shuffle clause has good utility against scapeshift decks and the graveyard hate clause works wonders against the four color kethis combo deck from last week and few other places but we re thinking bigger ll just lay it out for you if you play fall of the thran with an ashiok in play you can exile all of the lands in your opponent graveyard making fall of the thran one sided armageddon nice field of the dead time stamps match match match match match ashiok geddon core set standard jim davis planeswalkers jace wielder of mysteries ashiok dream render narset parter of veils teferi hero of dominaria teferi time raveler instants cast down disfigure sorceries the elderspell legion end kaya wrath thought erasure enchantments fall of the thran oath of kaya lands plains swamp drowned catacomb glacial fortress godless shrine hallowed fountain isolated chapel watery grave sideboard disfigure duress noxious grasp the elderspell dovin veto ashiok dream render thief of sanity basilica bell haunt kaya wrath enter the god eternals buy this deck export text format export arena format hah well that embarrassing damn you field of the dead decks grafting the ashiok fall of the thran package onto esper control helps to give it an answer to field of the dead and other decks that try to go over the top with it while also removing any need for creatures to win the game thus blanking your opponent removal while ashiok and fall of the thran don perform well against more aggressive decks you re already very well situated there and as we saw they are going to have dead creature removal as well if you re control player looking for different take on esper control or just an evil person who loves destroying their opponent lands give ashiok geddon spin follow jim davis on twitter and twitch https twitter com jimdavismtg https www twitch tv jimdavismtg
finally it the day we ve all been waiting for since modern horizons we have lived in the shadow of hogaak arisen necropolis which managed to sneakily dodge ban cycle by fooling everyone into thinking bridge from below was the real problem and not the new card with the old mechanic that already has multiple cards on the modern ban list thankfully we no longer have to live with that mistake sorry hogaak don let the door hit you on the way out okay great we can finally start thinking about hogaak less modern my record at the mythic championship with goblins was certainly tainted by record against hogaak maybe we can start there how does saheeli combo sound can we start playing fair decks again so many questions so let get started on figuring sorry what oh no you didn well the truth is they did wizards of the coast has finally pulled the trigger and banned faithless looting in modern yes faithless looting has been one of the most played cards in the format in the last few years some have called it modern brainstorm likening it to one of the key features of the legacy format which is that basically every deck plays brainstorm it at the point in legacy now where everyone just accepts that brainstorm is the most played card and nobody wants to do anything about it because it brainstorm format the problem is faithless looting isn like brainstorm faithless looting like the other hot button modern enabler ancient stirrings isn very good by itself you can just add faithless looting to any modern deck that can cast it and automatically make it better and more consistent putting faithless looting or ancient stirrings into your deck means your deck cares about something maybe you want to discard lingering souls for value or try to set up goryo vengeance into griselbrand or start dredging life from the loam or put hollow one into play quickly whatever it is that you re doing with faithless looting you ve got pretty clearly defined deck building purpose all brainstorm asks is that you play fetchlands basically required mana base in most legacy decks anyway cards like brainstorm or to use more modern analogous cards ponder or preordain tend to stifle deck building and have homogenizing effect on the format when every fair deck has to start with four copies of ponder and four copies of preordain there less room for other cards that actually do things you find the proper removal spells and tarmogoyf you need in very even and consistent distribution and go about doing roughly the same thing every game while playing cards that are individually the best at their respective points on the curve you have very little incentive to play any cards that require work to be good because all your work is done for you cards like faithless looting and ancient stirrings require work just look at some of the cards that are not only playable but have been downright format staples in the last few years because of faithless looting and ancient stirrings that awesome yes sometimes things go bit too far it can be frustrating to be on the receiving end of two arclight phoenix attacking you on turn two or stinkweed imp dredge that hits three creeping chill the turn before you re going to kill your opponent or another turn three karn liberated however before any of these decks got taken to the limit and received one too many good pieces that put them way over the top they were really sweet brews that any magic player would look at and go wow that really cool piece of deck building don take away the powerful and interesting deck building tool take away the cards that actually cause the problems while faithless looting may have gotten those arclight phoenix in the graveyard it was manamorphose ease of allowing you to cast three spells on turn two that brought them back ahead of schedule sure maybe you could race dredge but not when they start the game with an point life swing in their favor sorry why can vintage decks only play one mox sapphire but modern decks can play four all of these things are just happening turn too fast furthermore if you were to ban card like manamorphose or creeping chill you directly target the card that is causing the problem by supercharging deck faster than it should be and more importantly only damaging that deck the only decks that play manamorphose are arclight phoenix decks and old storm decks and neither deck is using the card reasonably creeping chill is only played in dredge surgically remove the problem don just drop the hammer on whole swath of decks that were never even involved in the dirty things that faithless looting was doing and yes understand the argument that leaving faithless looting in the format leaves the door open for more problems as more graveyard cards are printed there are two solutions to that don print cards like creeping chill which do almost nothing in any format except make dredge obnoxious if something does slip through the cracks which will inevitably happen cough cough hogaak then deal with it on case by case basis banning cards happens in modern and while it not pretty it also rarely entirely unexpected or surprising free cards that do things ahead of schedule are more damaging to the modern format than good synergy based mana enablers wait we re not done yet really now stoneforge mystic finally being freed isn necessarily bad thing while there are certainly concerns with homogenization when it comes to what threats fair decks are going to play stoneforge mystic doesn seem out of line in fairly wild modern format both jace the mind sculptor and bloodbraid elf once sheer terrors of the format came off the ban list with relative ease despite significant fear from the community helping to prove how hard playing fair in modern can really be stoneforge mystic helps to tip the scale of modern back toward fair decks giving them yet another excellent tool in their war against modern many varied linear strategies modern horizons hogaak notwithstanding seemed to have this make fair decks better end goal in mind and stoneforge mystic certainly follows that goal coupled with new tools like force of negation stoneforge mystic could have real and positive effect on the format all for letting her lose and seeing where things end up in the absolute worst case scenario if she has to be rebanned so be it but that fairly unlikely the big question is why now when you run any sort of experiment the more variables you introduce at once the harder it is to get accurate results you can gauge the impact of any one variable because it gets blended in with the impact from the other variables making it hard to draw solid conclusions banning hogaak was already big deal but removing faithless looting from modern is one of the biggest upheavals the format has ever seen not to mention that modern horizons the single most impactful set to the modern format ever released really hasn gotten its fair shake yet because of the shadow of hogaak that lot of variables already brewing it seems more prudent to let the dust settle see where things end up and then consider reintroducing huge element like stoneforge mystic at period where things feel relatively stable is that less exciting well yes but pretty sure we ve had enough excitement for one day what would have done this is what would have liked to have seen yesterday announcement date august modern hogaak arisen necropolis banned manamorphose is banned creeping chill is banned mox opal is on the watch list stoneforge mystic is on the unban watch list there no doubt that hogaak arisen necropolis should have been banned but don like dropping huge bomb on the format as well cut out the problem cards keep an eye on other problems and look for good stable spots to consider adding to the format rather than subtracting from it also love the idea of tangible watch list both to let us know what wizards of the coast is thinking internally about certain problem cards as well as giving everyone some advance warning that their entire modern deck runs the risk of being defunct soon modern is long term format players buy into modern because they know they can feel comfortable learning and playing deck for long time to come in perhaps magic most popular format it is certainly format that needs to be kept in check because it can get pretty wild but it not format that takes well to massive sweeping change banning faithless looting in modern was mistake
it unusual when brand new standard deck pops up later in standard season it unlikely when that deck goes on to dominate an event however that exactly what happened recently in the mtg arena mcq the crew of ondrej strasky ivan floch and stanislav cifka have been tearing it up in standard lately with powerful and successful brews and quite frankly they ve done it again ve done some brewing with kethis the hidden hand on stream but had been viewing it as beefy eternal witness variant that wanted you to play with lots of legends but where saw eternal witness ondrej and friends saw yawgmoth will also known as one of the most powerful combo cards of all time the result surprisingly powerful combo deck time stamps match match match match kethis combo ondrej strasky mtg arena mcq creatures diligent excavator fblthp the lost kethis the hidden hand lazav the multifarious planeswalkers ashiok dream render tamiyo collector of tales teferi time raveler sorceries urza ruinous blast enchantments oath of kaya artifacts mox amber lands drowned catacomb godless shrine temple of mystery temple garden glacial fortress hallowed fountain temple of malady temple of silence breeding pool watery grave sideboard teshar ancestor apostle tamiyo collector of tales unmoored ego jace wielder of mysteries urza ruinous blast cerulean drake the elderspell tolsimir friend to wolves ashiok dream render legion end the immortal sun buy this deck export text format export arena format mix together some odd draft commons one card engine and some of the best cards in standard and what do you get kethis combo that what as you saw in the games the true power of this deck comes from the much maligned mox amber the ability to generate free diligent excavator triggers as well as free mana as you loop through every mox amber in your graveyard via the legend rule give the deck it combo potential in conjunction with the activated ability on kethis the hidden hand once you ve gotten through most of your deck it time to point your diligent excavator triggers at your opponent and finish them off as you also saw in the games this deck is tough to play this is not combo deck like scapeshift or show and tell where you play your card and do your thing and win there large amount of setup and finesse and then once you re actually there there bunch of busy work and going off to execute as well in lot of ways the deck resembles the old four color rally the ancestors decks or even modern ironworks decks however if you can get over the learning curve we re looking at and extremely powerful deck in standard right now when your combo deck gets to play the best card in the format teferi time raveler you know you re in good place just beware the rope
one of the great things about magic is how infinitely customizable it is with so many different and varied game pieces and such long history it almost as if there are many different games residing inside the overall scope of magic as whole playing vintage dredge against vintage shops is going to look like completely different game than playing core set draft much like playing six player commander game is going to look vastly different than standard esper control mirror it this amount of fluidity that brings us back over and over again and is why magic has been going for quarter of century with no signs of slowing down there just such huge sandbox to play in that it never feels like you reach the sides formats themselves constantly change but if you ever grow tired of one there always something else to try of course this brings problems as well the reason we have few big main formats think standard modern commander is that there needs to be some sort of uniformity in rule sets or else finding an opponent who wants to play the same game as you can be difficult you may love playing canadian highlander with your roommate at home but if you bring that canadian highlander deck to local store it pretty unlikely you are going to find anyone who also has canadian highlander deck to battle you with there are only so many players in each local store event meaning it can be hard to get two players who want to play semi obscure format in the same place at the same time this is where digital magic vastly outpaces tabletop magic sure on average prefer to play magic in tabletop than digital because like going places and interacting with people but the ease and logistics of digital magic allow for so much more with far less planning instead of only having the people in your immediate area available at times that are convenient to them you ve got every single magic player in the whole world who currently online to draw from now all you need to do is set up an interesting format for them to play and give them some incentive to play it and you re off to the races magic online chaos draft for the uninitiated chaos draft is wild and crazy format that also happens to be one of my favorites chaos draft is fairly simple in practice assemble eight or six players as you normally would for booster draft and proceed as normal the only difference is that you will not be drafting the most recent set but rather from random pool of booster packs from all different sets over magic history typically the ideal chaos draft has no repeating packs meaning every pack you see will be from different set you could end up with three starting packs of future sight onslaught and iconic masters or any other awesome mixture the problem with chaos draft is that logistically getting together chaos draft in paper is quite difficult not only do you need seven other players who want to chaos draft all in the same place at the same time but old packs are expensive booster pack of urza saga is going to run you cool here on coolstuffinc com and even more recent sets like innistrad are going to run you this makes getting an exciting spread of sets both difficult and expensive which really hampers the fun of chaos draft it feels awesome getting to open that old invasion pack and feel like you re touching magic history rather than just feeling like you re opening last year standard packs having chaos drafts on an online platform completely circumvents this issue as well as the issue of needing to get people together to actually do the draft thankfully magic online does just that bringing the chaos draft experience to us at various times as break from cube drafting this is awesome these sorts of fun formats are much easier to do on magic online and for years ve been calling for more things like this one of the biggest failings of online magic early on was that it tried to just exactly mimic paper magic rather than looking at unique things it could do and it great to see this both on magic online and mtg arena which we will get to shortly my only complaint is the current pool of packs available for magic online chaos drafts which has been curated to skip some early sets as well as remove all core sets and masters sets aside from the fact that think all sets should be available for history sake masters set high power level and synergies and core set great collection of baseline effects make putting together good chaos draft decks easier and more fun and who doesn love opening good masters pack would love to see this changed quick word on chaos draft strategy chaos draft is about thinking on your feet and trying to piece together synergy from across many different sets and themes because this isn easy to do you want to focus more on power than all out synergy while still finding nice little pockets of synergy to exploit make sure to try and have good top end and try to stay open and two colors while drafting unless there is very good fixing the format is definitely slower than normal draft so don be afraid to take the draw if you ve got lot of removal and or your opponent deck is slow good luck and enjoy mtg arena standard shakeup while ve lamented for years about the lack of crazy short term formats for magic online mtg arena has not made the same mistakes we ve seen all sorts of crazy game modes that usually last for weekend giving us the chance to explore something new with everyone else for short period of time the most recent was the standard shakeup something they ve done before and expect they will do more often as it is great fun the theme is simple what would happen if all the top cards in standard were suddenly banned as players get tired of playing against teferi time raveler and the standard metagame becomes more and more developed players are always looking for that great week one wild wild west format and this mode gives it to them of course if this was actually what standard looked like going forward it would be eventually solved as the new top cards would take their places in the top tier of the new format but by running it for only short time we get to have our fun and then move on that the best part of these fun short lived formats if somebody breaks it that awesome the format gets broken and is then gone in few days anyway no harm done it hard for me to properly emphasize how important things like this are for the health of digital magic as whole put simply alternate game modes like this are very fun much of the fun and challenge of magic is deck building and exploration which can feel stifled at times by the heavily competitive formats and the ranked ladder there infinite content and strategy available for any given normal standard format meaning that players can brute force their way into learning top deck and do well having these sorts of think on your feet formats really get the creative magic juices flowing can only hope we see more of these events though wish they would last little bit longer to ensure everyone gets chance to play with mtg arena first big rotation coming up we are going to have mtg arena cards not in standard for the first time on our accounts which opens the door up for even more format possibilities things like chaos draft could be great way to get older cards into newer players hands as well as formats that use cards both old and new ve been advocating for build your own standard on magic online for almost decade format where you get to choose few different sets to build your standard deck from and go from there and hopefully we get there one day on mtg arena if you haven tried any of these more out there game modes on mtg arena highly suggest it they encourage creativity are ton of fun and are frankly breath of fresh air when things get little stale like right now with pre rotation standard and pre hogaak ban modern the only downside when it comes to these events on mtg arena is that people don necessarily want to blow all of their wild cards on cards for an event that only last for few days which understand maybe wizards of the coast can make these events phantom or allow you to uncraft any card you crafted for the event itself at the end of it there so much that can be done with digital magic and hope wizards of the coast keeps being unafraid to push the envelope don fight the future digital magic is huge part of the future of magic would never want it to replace tabletop magic as there nothing better than being in room with other players and throwing down with something big on the line but digital magic has so many advantages over paper that they must be properly utilized digital magic is different medium than paper magic and these sorts of fun formats and events help to explore that medium in new and exciting ways let keep it up wizards of the coast
as we approach the end of standard format we re usually looking for two things is there anything fun and competitive not already doing well if there is will that deck survive rotation and for the answer to that question let me introduce you to my friend chandra and her friend chandra and her friend chandra too oh boy this is quite the paradox time stamps match match match match match chandra tribal core set standard jim davis planeswalkers karn scion of urza ugin the ineffable chandra awakened inferno tibalt rakish instigator chandra fire artisan saheeli sublime artificer chandra acolyte of flame sarkhan the masterless instants flame sweep chandra triumph shock sorceries jaya immolating inferno lava coil artifacts mox amber chandra regulator lands mountain interplanar beacon mobilized district sideboard alpine moon dire fleet daredevil lava coil unchained berserker goblin chainwhirler legion warboss buy this deck export text format export arena format who needs other colors when you have more chandras there such great density of planeswalkers in red that other colors aren even needed and with red excellent removal we form the core of very good superfriends style deck with mana base that is smooth as butter and that almost completely avoids rotation while the deck is called chandra tribal the real star of the show is sarkhan the masterless most planeswalker decks have the problem of grinding well but not winning very quickly this means that decks with huge endgames can go over the top of what they are doing not so with sarkhan who is able to take your opponent from to dead in two short turns already great card sarkhan is phenomenal when put in deck with total planeswalkers you also get to utilize chandra triumph which is very underrated removal spell in standard right now if you have chandra in your deck as it almost lightning strike on the floor but turns into pseudo bedevil if you do have chandra that an amazing deal for two mana in only one color the only real disappointment from the deck was chandra regulator which just doesn perform very well unless the game goes super late or we already have chandra in play we need most of our cards and if we mulligan or get thought erasure there just isn enough cardboard to go around to start looting in the midgame would replace at least one regulator with the fourth copy of chandra fire artisan and consider cutting the other as well all and all chandra tribal is blast the deck is fun competitive nice mixup before rotation and most importantly deck that is safe to pick up or craft because almost all of it remains playable post rotation furthermore once nexus of fate and scapeshift two endgames that go way over the top of planeswalkers rotate and the format powers down as whole the deck looks ever better let light it up
since the advent of the magic pro league and subsequent hiccups of seeing two of its members banned from magic the introduction of mtg arena into competitive play the removal of grand prix coverage and the removal of many of the professional programs that have been in place for almost two decades the future of professional magic has been very much in question further compounding the average magic player concerns has been the lack of any concrete information or announcements from wizards of the coast leaving everyone to wonder if there would even be tabletop competitive magic in well wizards of the coast went and dropped whole truck full of concrete information this wednesday and frankly things are looking pretty good fears about the future of competitive magic especially tabletop magic have been proven to be largely unfounded as there is robust plan in place running from your local game stores all the way up to the mpl some parts look familiar while some are new but there is no doubt that lot of time planning and money has gone into this new plan for organized play which instills large amount of excitement and confidence today we are going to go over the announcement and will be offering my thoughts on how each part of it works the mpl the magic pro league or mpl was the only piece of this puzzle that we really got from wizards of the coast when it came to competitive magic this year of the top players from were awarded big contracts for the year both to play in exclusive events as well as stream and promote magic as whole however completely left out was any information about how one gets into the mpl or what the mpl was going to look like year to year now we have our answers the mpl will be shrinking to players and will have turnover rate of up to eight players year the streaming contracts are going away but there will still be minimum of in appearance fees to be paid out to members of the mpl this is of course the bare minimum meaning this income will be supplemented by tournament winnings as well as any money made doing content creation or sponsorships this is being professional magic player to its highest degree to the point that people with good jobs may leave said jobs to play magic instead my thoughts with the mpl being so exclusive the exact logistics of it won matter directly to the large majority of magic players in the world however as far as keeping the game best and brightest in the game and under the spotlight this is excellent having an amount of stability and reliable income is extremely important for allowing professional magic player to feel comfortable choosing that vocation but having some amount of relegation is also important so making the mpl can be an attainable goal and there new blood in the system relegation is also extremely exciting from viewer standpoint which feels to be the main purpose of the mpl we want good tv the rivals league of course relegation has to lead somewhere and if that somewhere is back on the streets to play ptqs and try to start from the bottom again that not acceptable as such there is the new rivals league essentially the minor leagues of the mpl the rivals league is in lot of ways similar to what being platinum gold pro was before the rivals league is the home of mpl players who get relegated as well as new challengers from both digital and tabletop this is also where wotc will be putting their discretionary invites rather than directly into the mpl rivals league players will be qualified for most of the large events of the year as well as privy to up to in appearance fees as baseline floor the rivals league is the stepping stone to the mpl and the real target of players looking to make it into the mpl just like in baseball you re unlikely to make it in the majors unless you prove you can hack it in the minors first there will also be big end of the season gauntlet tournament where the top rivals league players battle against the bottom mpl players for the right to join the mpl my thoughts this is awesome the purpose of the mpl is to be the ultimate spectator experience for magic and having minor league system and the drama of players being relegated and promoted is excellent at present there are just the mpl players and their huge streaming contracts sitting on piles of money and there no excitement around it this is the excitement we need as viewers and imagine the gauntlet tournament will be great tv the rivals league also feels much more attainable than the mpl itself which makes it great end goal for higher level players the players tour pro tours mythic championships as we know them are no more they will be replaced with regional tournament system called the players tour in lot of ways these will essentially be mini pro tours that are region based you must qualify for them they award points that help get you into the rivals league they have large prize pools and top finishers qualify for players tour finals if players tour events are mini pro tours the players tour finals are basically super pro tours there are three players tour finals each season with smaller fields of around players and much larger prize pool that the normal players tour events relative to the size of the field the players tour events will have more overall players than the present mythic championship system has but the players tour finals will be more exclusive widening the middle ground between the lowest levels and the top of organized play my thoughts in lot of ways this is logical extension of the current mythic championship system having the main players tour events be regional fixes lot of issues having to do with travel and expenses both on wotc side of things as well as the players if you still really want to travel out of the country you are allowed to attend any players tour event outside of region this also gives them more high level events to cover presumably to make up for the lack of grand prix coverage having more overall slots available for pro level events is exciting for players at the bottom trying to qualify so not only is it logistically easier but more able to give budding competitive players taste of the highest levels of competitive play at the same time the system is providing higher level players with clear stepping stones all the way up to the mpl with almost every step feeling worthwhile in the process qualifiers of course the big question left is how do qualify for players tour event thankfully the answer is fairly simple and mostly what we are used to obviously every mpl and rivals league player will be invited as well as hall of fame players but beyond that qualifications will largely remain the same there will be ptqs wpn store ptqs and magic online ptqs grand prix will still award invites to players who top or have at least wins discretionary invites last chance qualifiers and perhaps most exciting is that there will be invites given to private tournament series like the scgtour that lot of different routes to get you started from essentially nothing my thoughts lot of this is just the bread of butter of what we are used to as tournament magic players the ability to do well at local ptq and convert that into huge win on the players tour is just like it was before with ptqs and the pro tour and that is exceedingly important for the health of competitive magic as whole the dream is huge selling point for competitive magic play and it feels alive and well everything about the qualification system and the levels of the tournament series has good flow to it the only major complaint going around so far is that without some sort of points based system in ptqs and grand prix consistent but near miss finishes are not rewarded it much harder to make top of three grand prix in row than spike one top but under the system as written those three top don matter very much however wotc has addressed this concern and said that they have something in the works to reward consistent finishes mtg arena on the mtg arena side of things the system will be largely what we are used to mtg arena mythic championships will be rebranded into mythic invitationals melding them into how the mythic invitational was run at pax east this year this means lot of money that esports flair and large amount of the game best players mixing in with qualifying mtg arena players and discretionary invite personalities the mythic ladder on mtg arena will again be the path to large qualifying events like the one happening tomorrow which will then feed directly into the mythic inviationals this system is simple and effective with the mythic invitationals seemingly more focused on the mpl and well known players to help push the mtg arena brand my thoughts everyone fear about the changes coming to tournament magic seemed centered around the notion that wotc was going to kill paper magic in favor of mtg arena tournaments the reality of this entire plan is quite the opposite most of the system for getting into the mpl or playing in high level magic events will be based on tabletop magic as the mtg arena system is fairly small and simple with only the three mythic invitationals over the course of the year and the various qualifying tournaments there certainly focus on the top players in these events which makes sense because they are more coverage centric and in the traditional esports model it going to be very hard to qualify for mythic invitational and doing so is going to involve healthy amount of luck by spiking an event however that isn necessarily bad thing and with every player in the mpl and rivals league eligible to play in mythic invitationals in small field for lot of money it is huge benefit for achieving placement in either of those leagues and promises an extremely exciting event to watch overall thoughts whew that was lot to take in all and all this announcement and entire system has me feeling very optimistic for the future of tournament magic there is healthy amount of focus on mtg arena and the esports side of things with the mpl and rivals league but also very large amount of the more established tabletop tournament magic we ve all known and loved for two decades while we don have all the nitty gritty details yet the entire system seems to have clear focus and path from the ptq at your local games store all the way to the mpl with the ability to enjoy each part of the system along the way that matches your level of play listen get it change is scary this is not the exact pro tour system we are used to yes trying to get into the mpl feels like ludicrously impossible goal but so is playing starting goaltender for the new york rangers having it be so elite and difficult to obtain gives it validity and relevance while ideally making the rivals league competition for the chance to obtain those coveted mpl slots the most exciting magic we ve ever watched as fans and no matter what there are still events for everyone to compete and strive for as making it to players tour event feels very obtainable and tangible the fear was that it was mpl or bust which is clearly not the case as both player and fan of magic excited to see how this all turns out as someone who has been very critical of wotc organized play choices in the past consider me cautiously optimistic this is great first step and if wotc can keep the ball rolling while communicating well and listening to feedback from its players we may have something very special brewing here
while modern currently operates under the shadow of hogaak arisen necropolis there are in fact other exciting cards in modern horizons hogaak will be banned sooner rather than later leaving us to begin searching for the best new elements that modern horizons adds to the format be lying if said thought snow theme would have been at the top of my list for major modern themes pushed in modern horizons but here we are there lot of power in the snow cards from modern horizons ranging all the way from mana fixing to card advantage to good threats and good removal when you get to mix these new snow cards with the smattering of snow cards already in the format like scrying sheets and ohran viper we get an exciting new archetype never seen before in modern time stamps match match match match match they said snow modern jim davis creatures abominable treefolk ice fang coatl boreal druid ohran viper planeswalkers teferi time raveler instants force of negation sorceries dead of winter enchantments marit lage slumber on thin ice spreading seas artifacts arcum astrolabe lands snow covered plains snow covered swamp snow covered forest snow covered island hallowed fountain temple garden windswept heath scrying sheets misty rainforest prismatic vista sideboard damping sphere dead of winter knight of autumn negate rest in peace stony silence geist of saint traft buy this deck export text format not bad league while we did lose an unfortunate match to eldrazi tron it not hard to see that the deck has some serious game force of negation is one of the most powerful new tools for fair decks in modern and we use it well and we re not so blinded by synergy that we can play great fair cards like teferi time raveler as well as all the awesome white sideboard cards there lot of potential cards we can play and directions we could go and this level of flexibility and interaction is great maybe we could go temur for wrenn and six and blood moon or maybe sultai to go harder on dead of winter and some better removal the core of the deck is simic so there lot of customization available snow is an exciting new archetype in modern and we re just scratching the surface follow jim davis on twitter and twitch https twitter com jimdavismtg https www twitch tv jimdavismtg
both standard and modern are in weird spot right now standard is in its usual prerotation lull period where we know that upheaval is coming and therefore don want to get too invested but there an odd twist core set made some old cards really good again but in few months those cards won be playable anymore field of the dead will no longer have scapeshift sorin imperious bloodlord will no longer have ixalan vampires marauding raptor will no longer have ixalan dinosaurs and so on it feels very odd that all of the big new standard decks of the moment currently rely on cards that are going away very soon on the modern side of things everyone is basically just sitting around waiting for hogaak arisen necropolis to be banned there is zero doubt in my mind it will be after putting up unheard of numbers at mythic championship iv despite leyline of the void being the most commonly played card in the room the only question is when the issue is that everyone playing modern is just in limbo right now you can be exactly sure what you want your deck to look like or how your new deck is going to perform in the warped hogaak metagame but players also aren playing hogaak as much as they should be because nobody wants to invest in deck that is going to be banned so we ve got the two biggest formats in magic slogging along in form of purgatory what are we supposed to do not play magic go outside and do something else psssh today ve got two exciting decks for each format which can hopefully hold you over until we leave the rotation ban based purgatory we are in all four of these decks are relatively safe from rotation in standard and likely to improve in post hogaak world in modern there still fun to be had chandra tribal core set standard jim davis planeswalkers karn scion of urza ugin the ineffable chandra awakened inferno saheeli sublime artificer tibalt rakish instigator chandra acolyte of flame chandra fire artisan sarkhan the masterless instants flame sweep chandra triumph shock sorceries jaya immolating inferno lava coil artifacts mox amber chandra regulator lands mountain field of ruin interplanar beacon mobilized district sideboard alpine moon dire fleet daredevil fry unchained berserker goblin chainwhirler legion warboss lava coil buy this deck export text format export arena format all chandra all the time there are quite the array of powerful planeswalkers concentrated in red and with chandra acolyte of flame and chandra awakened inferno joining the party we get to point where we can build mono colored superfriends style deck all three chandras are card advantage engines with upside with fire artisan providing raw card advantage acolyte of flame providing planeswalker removal and snapcaster mage like access to your graveyard and awakened inferno killing things sweeping the board and providing an unstoppable win condition chandra regulator further compounds how much you can do each turn while also providing red with atypical card selection however the best planeswalker in the deck is actually sarkhan the masterless who allows you to turn the corner and kill very quickly typically planeswalker decks get stuck in the midgame where they get board full of planeswalkers but don actually kill their opponent who has chance to go over the top of them with big effects like nexus of fate mass manipulation scapeshift or command the dreadhorde sarkhan kills very quickly your other planeswalkers help mount your defenses and shore up your other weaknesses otherwise you ve got bunch of removal spells headlined by the underrated chandra triumph to plow the road for your planeswalkers while also keeping your opponent planeswalkers in check you also get lot of value out of your lands by staying one color allowing full playsets of interplanar beacon and mobilized district which help to keep you alive and turn the corner respectively you ll be saying lets light it up in no time four color legends core set standard jim davis creatures shalai voice of plenty yarok the desecrated fblthp the lost kethis the hidden hand planeswalkers narset parter of veils teferi hero of dominaria vraska golgari queen tamiyo collector of tales teferi time raveler instants tyrant scorn sorceries urza ruinous blast yawgmoth vile offering thought erasure enchantments oath of kaya artifacts mox amber lands hinterland harbor isolated chapel hallowed fountain overgrown tomb woodland cemetery breeding pool drowned catacomb glacial fortress godless shrine watery grave sideboard noxious grasp ashiok dream render hero of precinct one duress narset parter of veils disfigure gideon blackblade legion end buy this deck export text format export arena format our next deck is built around strange but powerful card from core set kethis the hidden hand kethis the hidden hand is lot of power in somewhat difficult to use package three colors is lot and kethis demands you play with many legends in your deck or he doesn do much thankfully many of the most powerful cards in standard are legendary multicolored planeswalkers getting to play an array of powerful planeswalkers is great and kethis not only reduces their mana costs but also makes extra use of them when they bite the dust teferi is great for keeping the board clear while tamiyo helps to fill the graveyard for kethis because the deck is mostly non creature based anyway we get to play lot of interaction and fuel up with narset as well in fact the deck borrows lot of its midrange core from esper control which is good pedigree to jump off from aside from the more standard interaction of things like tyrant scorn thought erasure and oath of kaya which is amazing with kethis we also get pair of game ending legendary sorceries urza ruinous blast mops up huge boards while leaving almost all of your stuff untouched and can be bought back for more with kethis or tamiyo against decks less interested in going wide yawgmoth vile offering is blowout offering all of the power of the eldest reborn in one shot there fear that we are too midrangey against over the top decks like scapeshift so we get sweet sideboard plan of hero of precinct one when we need to apply pressure most of the cards in the deck are naturally multicolored and your opponent should be boarding out lot of their removal after seeing so few creatures in game this one blast modern they said snow modern jim davis creatures abominable treefolk ice fang coatl boreal druid ohran viper planeswalkers teferi time raveler instants force of negation sorceries dead of winter enchantments marit lage slumber on thin ice spreading seas artifacts arcum astrolabe lands snow covered plains snow covered swamp snow covered forest snow covered island hallowed fountain temple garden windswept heath scrying sheets misty rainforest prismatic vista sideboard damping sphere dead of winter knight of autumn negate plague engineer rest in peace stony silence tireless tracker buy this deck export text format moving on to modern we tackle the under loved snow theme that got big shot in the arm from modern horizons while all the fuss has been about hogaak there are number of great new tools for fair decks as well while it wasn an expected theme in modern horizons there is quite the package of good snow cards available ice fang coatl is perhaps the most powerful on rate comparing favorably to baleful strix in legacy but that not all on thin ice does nice path to exile impression but is also snow permanent to help out our other snow matters cards perhaps the most surprising is abominable treefolk which looks like limited card but hits very hard when you get to construct your deck completely it also dodges good amount of removal spells and blockers in the format as far as payoffs go marit lage slumber and dead of winter are both game altering effects and last but not least perhaps the most important snow card of all arcum astrolabe does everything you could ever want add these to the small package of good snow cards we already had in modern and things start to come together quite nicely ohran viper is great offensive threat that also plays great defense while boreal druid is nice cog scrying sheets is one of our biggest payoffs providing never ending card advantage at very little cost throw in some of the best interactive elements in modern and you ve got quite the midrange package with tools to handle almost everything force of negation is going to be very important card in the post hogaak world and this deck makes great use of it playing four colors also gives you access to bunch of great sideboard options this deck is blast look for an updated version in my video this coming monday right here on coolstuffinc com dice factory modern origin unknown creatures walking ballista coretapper planeswalkers karn the great creator artifacts ensnaring bridge astral cornucopia chalice of the void everflowing chalice mishra bauble mox opal mystic forge surge node

urza liquimetal coating mycosynth lattice sorcerous spyglass spellskite tormod crypt welding jar witchbane orb buy this deck export text format our last deck of the day comes from random list saved on my desktop while back and didn save the deck builder name and it weird one the dice factory shell has been around for while in numerous forms sometimes with numerous colors for things like ancient stirrings or whir of invention this one eschews all of that for very straightforward colorless build with some straightforward payoffs at its core however is an odd mana engine surge node everflowing chalice coretapper what going on here the basic goal of the early game is to use surge node and core tapper to add lots of counters to everflowing chalice and astral cornucopia often both played for zero mana to start by adding counters every turn you get to make very large amount of mana very fast which fuels your endgame mox opal stands in as well as even more broken mana acceleration once you ve got ton of mana karn the great creator lets you go find mycosynth lattice or liquimetal coating for the lock down or other artifact pieces as needed mystic forge also creates quite the engine similar to experimental frenzy further helping you get what you need online while inventors fair is free value way to also get what you need in the end you kill them walking ballista or karn activations after they are locked out the deck also contains some prison elements for defense with all the charge counter shenanigans happening this is probably the best chalice of the void deck ever and hiding behind ensnaring bridge while you do your mystic forge thing also feels great you get some more value from your lands and sideboard but the core of the deck is fairly straightforward this deck is wild and creates some crazy game states it also surprisingly good you get to do your thing pretty quickly and chalice of the void and ensnaring bridge are huge problems for some decks just make sure you ve got enough dice with you there always something fun it can be discouraging when formats feel stale or dead but there always something fun to be done it can often just require thinking outside the box it can also be refreshing to dip your toes into different format as well used to playing standard why not give cube draft shot modern player you could learn lot from playing core set limited being able to play all different types of formats is great way to grow and learn as magic player as it helps to develop your overall magic iq besides what are you going to do not play magic
reanimation spells are always tough cookie when it comes to magic design make them too cheap like reanimate and exhume and they come online too quickly to be dealt with make them too expensive like zombify and rise from the grave and they are too easy to answer from an already developed board state well recently wizards of the coast found the happy medium they were looking for adding haste to your five mana reanimation spell means your reanimation target can affect the board immediately giving you value and the ability to damage your opponent board state even if they are able to answer it on their turn haste is one of the best keywords in magic and you get all the power of card like through the breach with the added benefit of not losing your threat if only we had something really good to give haste core set delivers again time stamps match match match match sultai reanimator core set standard jim davis creatures tomebound lich drakuseth maw of flames planeswalkers narset parter of veils tamiyo collector of tales instants cast down disfigure sorceries cry of the carnarium duress ritual of soot bond of revival chart course thought erasure lands island swamp breeding pool hinterland harbor overgrown tomb woodland cemetery drowned catacomb watery grave sideboard duress negate enter the god eternals noxious grasp search for azcanta thief of sanity ritual of soot ashiok dream render buy this deck export text format wrapped around very nice sultai but essentially just dimir midrange shell bond of revival for drakuseth is home run of an endgame most of our core cards like thought erasure cast down narset parter of veils and friends all have quite the pedigree already and enablers like chart course and tomebound lich fit right in perfectly tamiyo collector of tales is our only green card but she is well worth the splash as she does basically everything we could ask for she fills the graveyard helps us play our midrange control game and makes it super easy to find the right pieces to reanimate drakuseth by keeping the mana base mostly dimir we also have very easy mana with number of basic lands as well if you re looking for fun and power wrapped up into one nice little standard package sultai reanimator is where it at you get to have an insanely powerful and fun win condition but also play lot of great proven cards as well which is typically recipe for success in standard so go forth an burninate the standard countryside
yesterday we went over my mythic championship goblins deck as well as the finer points of playing the deck and today we ve got even more goblins stuff for you however let quickly go over my predictions for mythic championship iv first and see how we did then we can get to the goblin goodness prediction one there will be at least total graveyard hate cards in top correct my rough count looking over the top lists was pieces of graveyard hate between maindecks and sideboards and that not including ways to fetch them like karn the great creator or whir of invention with leyline of the void being the most played card in the tournament by wide margin this one was breeze prediction two no player will have perfect record in constructed correct while there ton of hogaak decks among the and decklists from the event no player managed perfect record considering the wildness of the modern format how swingy some matchups can be and the wild amount of hogaak mirrors hinging on leyline of the void this makes lot of sense prediction three jund will be among the top four most played decks partial credit so close while jund came just two players shy of fourth place among most played decks at the event it was still strongly in the running for most played decks in the event and put up very respectable win rate second only to hogaak decks among decks with at least players with jund going from almost unplayed to one of the top played decks and great win percentage going to give myself partial credit on this one prediction four at least half of the drafters will make top correct four players had perfect records in modern horizons draft at the event jack kiefer thoralf serverin david mines and jacob wilson and both thoralf and david would go on to make top with thoralf taking down the event count it prediction five izzet phoenix will underperform with sub win rate incorrect very close but izzet phoenix managed to swing just above average win rate over large sample size of players certainly not impressive but just smidge over the line of my prediction better luck next time overall pretty good round of predictions goblins sideboard and matchup guide as spoke about in yesterday article goblins is deck where your game plan varies drastically depending on what you are playing against recognizing what your game plan and endgame is going to look like and making all of your plays to work toward that endgame is paramount to your success as goblins player we re going to go over the major matchups in modern right now both with sideboard notes as well as quick bit on how each matchup plays out but first our updated decklist goblins modern jim davis creatures pashalik mons mogg fanatic sling gang lieutenant goblin piledriver goblin matron goblin ringleader goblin warchief mogg war marshal munitions expert skirk prospector instants tarfire artifacts aether vial lands bloodstained mire blood crypt auntie hovel cavern of souls field of ruin scalding tarn snow covered mountain sideboard goblin cratermaker goblin chainwhirler goblin trashmaster icon of ancestry leyline of the void pashalik mons relic of progenitus thoughtseize buy this deck export text format while don expect it to last past the next banned and restricted update hogaak is still legal so we are still going to have the full playset of leyline of the void clogging up our sideboard two mogg fanatic make their way into the main deck to help slow down decks like humans in the early game and more importantly try and delay turn two hogaak by killing the enabler creatures before they can convoke if you can delay hogaak by one turn you can often race it on to the matchups hogaak unfavorable matchup game is tough the hogaak matchup is pure race and when your opponent is able to play an trample on turn two it is pretty hard to race prioritize speed over everything and try to take advantage of the fact that they don block well if you have prior information to what they are playing before game mulligan aggressively to fast hand post board your best bet is to london mulligan to leyline of the void and let it rip they can beat you if leyline is in play as beatdown can ever beat mogg war marshall but they are fairly resilient at finding an answer to leyline try to use the time they waste answering leyline to race if they have plague engineer too you re in world of hurt as you can afford to leave in answers to it and board in all your graveyard hate board in thoughtseize on the play to try and nab their nature claim and don be afraid to go down to or cards looking for leyline on the play in leyline of the void relic of progenitus thoughtseize pashalik mons goblin chainwhirler out goblin ringleader tarfire goblin piledriver munitions expert field of ruin skirk prospector on the draw in leyline of the void relic of progenitus pashalik mons goblin chainwhirler out goblin ringleader tarfire goblin piledriver munitions expert field of ruin izzet phoenix even matchup izzet phoenix is very swingy matchup for tribal deck we are surprisingly good against thing in the ice an active aether vial means the awoken horror will rarely get that first attack in we have goblin piledriver to block and attack through it and many of our creatures like goblin matron and ringleader like being bounced anyway however we are not as good against quick arclight phoenix draws that can cheese us out before we can get our card advantage online aria of flame can also combo us sometimes before we can kill them if the game gets grindy or slow we are in great shape but the faster they are the harder it can be for us do whatever you can to not get cheesed out via damage and don be afraid to use real removal on the phoenixes to save life post board we gain access to relic of progenitus to help contain the phoenix draws and they don gain ton play grindy but try to recognize when you are going to need to turn the corner quickly to beat multiple phoenixes or aria of flame in relic of progenitus goblin cratermaker out mogg fanatic pashalik mons eldrazi tron favorable matchup most of what eldrazi tron is doing isn relevant against you chalice of the void is already unimpressive and that before you factor in that cavern of souls can allow you to play your drops anyway ensnaring bridge merely slows us down and big eldrazi idiots don battle with us too well large walking ballista can be annoying but with four field of ruin we can usually keep them off tron just be aware of all is dust play grindy game and kill everything with your munitions experts post board they don gain ton as most of their sideboard is karn the great creator targets but you do need to watch out for torpor orb if they have it we gain some nice tools and this matchup is great for us barring some very early reality smasher in goblin cratermaker goblin trashmaster pashalik mons out mogg fanatic tarfire humans even matchup on paper would think humans would be very good matchup we have similar strategy but have ton of card advantage and removal and their interactive elements like meddling mage and kitesail freebooter don do much however ve found the matchup to be little harder than expected if they can have fast draw play defensively and focus on picking off evasive creatures taking as little damage as possible and moving into the midgame so you can out draw them with goblin ringleader pashalik mons can be big here as machine gun post board auriok champion is major annoyance and why not willing to say this is firm good matchup one auriok champion isn that bad but if they are able to start copying it with phantasmal image and pumping with thalia lieutenant things can get difficult you can usually overcome the lifegain if you can gain board control as they won interact with goblin warchief at all but you may die to the unstoppable attackers before you can kill them if they have plague engineer as well you may need to shave more toughness creatures in pashalik mons goblin cratermaker goblin chainwhirler out goblin piledriver skirk prospector control highly favorable matchup the control matchup is every goblin player dream they have no clock worthless counterspells and no way to stop the onslaught of card advantage coming from goblin ringleader it requires careful play on the goblin player part but is an excellent matchup make sure you pace yourself and put just enough threats in play to deal damage and stop planeswalkers without walking into supreme verdict try and hold onto your goblin warchief and haste creatures so you can follow up supreme verdict or planeswalker with haste threat and protect your cavern of souls from field of ruin when you can post board your goal is not to let them cheese you out with some sort of fast win condition like monastery mentor pace yourself don play into counterspells when you can and make them squirm as they use path to exile on your goblin tokens avoid fetching for basic lands whenever you can so you can get maximum value from their path to exile and field of ruin even if it means fetching blood crypt when you don need to in goblin chainwhirler icon of ancestry pashalik mons out mogg fanatic tarfire skirk prospector jund favorable matchup the favorable tag here assumes they don have plague engineer after board but all and all you grind with jund very well liliana of the veil looks embarrassing against mogg war marshall and goblin ringleader and their best path to victory is cheesing you out with fast tarmogoyf and bloodbraid elf attacks as long as you don get cheesed out by fast double discard aggro draw you should be in good shape if they want to play cards like and extra removal they can beat us if they want to but that not what jund currently looks like post board we cut down on many of our toughness creatures to lessen our vulnerability to wrenn and six and plague engineer and continue to grind icon of ancestry is our ace in the hole as both preemptive answer to plague engineer and wrenn and six and card advantage tool relic of progenitus helps to keep tarmogoyf in check and once we can cut the leyline of the void and play more this matchup will improve in icon of ancestry goblin cratermaker relic of progenitus pashalik mons out skirk prospector mogg fanatic sling gang lieutenant tron even to unfavorable matchup the good news against tron is that they aren really going to interact with you at all you can fire off turn two goblin warchief off of skirk prospector and get super aggressive going for that turn four kill which is not luxury you usually have the bad news is that if you don kill them fast their late game vastly outpowers your goblin ringleader field of ruin helps but it pure race thoughtseize helps after board but realistically we re not super prepared for classic tron again once the leyline of the void go we can make room for something like alpine moon to improve the matchup goblin trashmaster can help contain wurmcoil engine in thoughtseize goblin cratermaker goblin trashmaster out goblin ringleader munitions expert tarfire urza thopter sword favorable matchup most of what the urza thopter sword deck is good at finding ensnaring bridge hating people out with maindeck silver bullets or assembling thopter foundry sword of the meek isn very good against us the thopter sword combo is slow in the early turns and goblin piledriver gets to rumble through untouched for easy kills with protection from blue we have tons of ways around ensnaring bridge and they don interact with us very well their best chance to win is to cheese us out with fast thopter foundry sword of the meek urza lord high artificer combo kill but that is difficult to assemble early post board we gain access to the all powerful goblin trashmaster as well as getting to shave some of our stinkers play aggressively but carefully and do what you can to keep them from comboing in goblin trashmaster goblin cratermaker thoughtseize out mogg fanatic tarfire goblin ringleader other matchups those were the eight most played decks at the mythic championship but obviously there are about more viable decks in modern and we can cover them all however this has been great spread of different decks ranging from very slow to very fast and all ranges in between your goal is to follow similar paradigm to sideboard as you do to your matchup assessment think about how the game is going to end and what sort of plan you need to play for and sideboard accordingly against medium to slow decks goblin ringleader is usually your best card but against the faster and more linear decks of the format it is often goblin warchief they won be interacting so punish them and kill them as fast as possible the deck is difficult to play and rewards knowing your matchups so make sure you get as much practice in as possible hedge around plague engineer when you can play tight and enjoy goblining people
while everyone else was deciding how many leyline of the void to play in their hogaak main deck was writing goblin ringleader on my decklist at mythic championship iv in barcelona spain last weekend while this was my first mythic championship pro tour in few years was not memeing with the addition of goblin ringleader goblin matron sling gang lieutenant and munitions expert goblins is legitimately good deck in modern ultimately would end up with very medium finish in draft in constructed for an overall placing of th place good enough for top pay jump from min cash but the entire tournament would end up being skewed by the big bad gak three of my five losses would come at the hands of the gak with ken yukuhiro and shahar shenhar both really going the extra mile by playing multiple copies of plague engineer in their hogaak sideboards despite feeling prepared for hogaak going into the tournament still underestimated the deck both in how much it would be played and how resilient it would be in post sideboard games against leyline of the void thankfully the obscene numbers put up by hogaak at the mythic championship all but guarantees that it won be legal as soon as the ban list gets updated which makes my record against it in the event much more palatable including hogaak my matchups were as such grixis urza control hardened scales hogaak hogaak whir prison control hogaak hogaak burn most of my non hogaak wins were fairly lopsided and both hardened scales and burn losses were extremely close we should be expecting major metagame shift going forward once hogaak is banned which should bode well for goblins if the format continues to trend toward fair decks as the trajectory had been force of negation is great and goblins is fantastic against force of negation but enough about my mythic championship this is going to be two part article with today showcasing game play and going over the overall strategy of the deck and friday article containing the all important updated list and sideboard guide let get to the deck and the games goblins modern jim davis th place mythic championship iv creatures goblin cratermaker knucklebone witch pashalik mons sling gang lieutenant goblin piledriver goblin matron goblin ringleader goblin warchief mogg war marshal munitions expert skirk prospector instants tarfire artifacts aether vial lands arid mesa bloodstained mire wooded foothills blood crypt scalding tarn auntie hovel cavern of souls field of ruin snow covered mountain sideboard earwig squad goblin chainwhirler goblin trashmaster icon of ancestry leyline of the void pashalik mons relic of progenitus thoughtseize buy this deck export text format formats move fast with classic tron winning both the mythic championship as well as the scg tour open in columbus last weekend it not surprising at all that we played against it twice in this league my deck was built with eldrazi tron in mind one of the more popular decks at the mythic championship but not classic tron we also had some problems with auriok champion and plague engineer two cards that will need to be addressed going forward thankfully once hogaak is banned that opens up bunch of sideboard space where we can help solve these issues don want to focus too much on the specific results of this league or this decklist because the format is likely to change but rather the overall strategy of goblins as whole goblins is perhaps one of the most misunderstood decks in the history of magic which unsurprisingly also makes it exceedingly difficult to pilot here are some key things to remember for you potential goblin players out there goblins is not an aggro deck yes you are playing nearly mono red deck full of creatures with haste and damage dealing abilities however if you treat goblins like an aggro deck you re going to end up on the wrong side of the match slip more often than not nobody is consistently winning games of magic in modern by casting goblin piledriver into goblin warchief and hoping the beatdowns are good enough the individual power level of your cards isn high enough to brute force your way through which means your goal is to set them up to work together to become more than the sum of their parts and then use them in the proper way that each particular matchup calls for goblins is board control combo deck develop your mana kill things draw cards make favorable trades tutor the card you need draw more cards eventually win sound familiar in many ways goblins plays out like control deck you spend the early turns setting up your endgame while interacting killing your opponent important pieces and disrupting their overall game plan just like deck playing jace the mind sculptor or sphinx revelation you know every resource exchange is good for you because you have the late game inevitability of an extremely powerful card draw engine goblin ringleader will keep the gas flowing until very late in the game when you ve finally run out of goblin matron and goblin ringleader to chain together this ability to out draw the other fair decks in the format gives you an edge in any game that goes long which makes it your job to play towards that inevitability know your role of course not every deck is going to play fair and herein lay the challenge goblins is deck that does not have universal game to game plan you can play out in each match deck like tron or dredge has the same basic plan for each game get all three tron lands in play play really expensive stuff get dredge card in the graveyard dredge as much as possible goblins is very different knowing how you want each game to play out and end goes very long way toward how you need to play each turn of each game whereas you can take all of the time in the world against deck like control and slowly grind them into dust if you take the same stance against deck like tron or neoform combo they will destroy you will their over the top late game on the other side of things if you re constantly just using goblin matron to find goblin warchief and goblin piledriver to go for quick kills against decks with lots of removal you re going to find yourself with no cards in hand and no creatures in play very quickly knowing how to approach each individual matchup takes time patience and experience and is the true challenge in playing deck like goblins in some matchups it is correct to chump block with goblin piledriver on turn three in some matchups you board out all but one goblin ringleader typically the most powerful card in the deck how do you know which is right have plan for each matchup the way to figure out when either is correct is to know your role in each matchup and know what your endgame is going to look like once you have done this you can properly asses the value of all your opponent threats what cards you need to get with goblin matron and how offensively or defensively you should be playing the game every play must be made with purpose that falls in line with your overall plan it correct to chump block with goblin piledriver on turn three when you recognize that the only way you re going to lose is if you get cheesed out by early damage taking five damage shot from an early tarmogoyf may allow your jund opponent to get you into lightning bolt range and steal game you ve started to run away with via card advantage from goblin ringleader it correct to board our your goblin ringleader and go into full on aggro plan when you are faced with deck that is much faster than your card advantage engines deck like neoform or storm isn going to care how many cards you draw with goblin ringleader when they kill you all in one shot rather than trying to trade resources and play for the long game your plan shifts to cards like goblin warchief goblin piledriver and skirk prospector looking to kill as quickly as possible the beauty of goblins is that it is capable of playing many different roles so the option you want is usually there sideboard guide and updated list these are the nuts and bolts basics to playing goblins properly if you re serious about learning to play goblins in modern or legacy these concepts must be learned and they re pretty timeless as formats change and different cards come and go as far as the specifics we ll you ll just have to tune in on friday where ll post my updated decklist as well as sideboard guide for the top matchups in the format
it mythic championship time and that means it also predictions time as has become tradition here on coolstuffinc com am here on the eve of the mythic championship with my big five predictions for how the event is going to go with modern horizons giving the format huge shakeup as well as the recent bridge from below banning things are going to be wild even cooler is that am currently in barcelona as you re reading this looking to make my own mark on the predictions any and all accusations of fixing these predictions can be sent to my editor let get started prediction one there will be at least total graveyard hate cards in top look get it bridge from below got banned as big papa wizards of the coast came down to save us from the graveyard monster it had created when it printed hogaak arisen necropolis in modern horizons so all is back to normal right wrong hogaak is still really messed up magic card even without the ability to mill over your entire deck and your opponent entire deck in concert with alter of dementia the deck becomes almost entirely one dimensional post banning but the dimension of put power into play on turn two is pretty damn good plan hogaak modern kanister st place mtgo modern challenge creatures carrion feeder golgari thug insolent neonate bloodghast gravecrawler hogaak arisen necropolis satyr wayfinder stitcher supplier vengevine instants darkblast lightning axe sorceries claim fame faithless looting lands swamp blood crypt bloodstained mire gemstone mine marsh flats overgrown tomb polluted delta verdant catacombs blackcleave cliffs sideboard assassin trophy fatal push force of vigor leyline of the void nature claim plague engineer shenanigans thoughtseize buy this deck export text format mpl member piotr glogowski ran perfect record through the weekend magic online modern challenge last weekend putting everyone who didn already know on notice that the gak hasn gone anywhere anyone who is going to do well at this mythic championship will be well aware of the decks power and whether they try to beat hogaak or just play it themselves they will be packing the appropriate amount of graveyard hate to keep the deck in check this is no time to skimp on graveyard hate and those who don will be rewarded prediction two no player will have perfect record in constructed modern is wild world the dream for any mythic championship or pro tour is that some team finds completely unexpected deck breaks the format and runs away with the event totally blindsiding the competition the thing is that almost never happens anymore modern has been multi headed beast for long time and there are so many angles and aspects to the format that it almost impossible to perfectly predict what will happen furthermore the fail rates and raw power of many decks means that sometimes upsets will happen regardless of how matchup looks on paper maybe you ve got the expected metagame on lockdown and perfectly tuned your deck for the top six decks in the field only to end up playing against bogles or burn while at high level event there will be much higher concentration of the better decks in the format modern is the play what you know format and sometimes what your opponent knows is exactly what good against you as such doubt there will be any dominance in barcelona no player will run the modern tables prediction three jund will be among the top four most played decks what if told you that jund was one of the best decks in modern right now add this to the fact that higher level players tend to love fair decks especially in modern and we re looking at resurgence of the poster child for fair in modern and what the impetus for this jund resurgence wrenn and six is hell of card if told you there was planeswalker that plused to gain card advantage minused to kill creatures and could do so more than once and still be alive and went immediately up to four loyalty when it entered the battlefield imagine you be interested now what if told you it cost only two mana wrenn and six is the second two mana planeswalker ever printed they were really really really safe with the first one but have held nothing back the second time around wrenn and six is already turning legacy upside down and while modern doesn have wasteland it does have many other great ways to use wrenn and six and frankly just drawing extra lands and cards to discard to liliana of the veil is often enough wrenn and six is the real deal and jund is the current beneficiary prediction four at least half of the drafters will make top modern horizons limited is an extremely deep and challenging draft format there are plenty of draftable archetypes but they aren locked on rails like some other synergy based formats there huge amount of crossover among archetypes and overall strategies making the draft and deck build challenging but rewarding exercise the players who put in the work will be amply rewarded with modern being such wildcard and modern horizons draft being so skill intensive have no problem predicting that at least half of the players who manage perfect record in the draft portion will be able to parley that into top berth the players who run those will be very skilled and as long as they can come out just little better than average in modern that should be good enough to get there prediction five izzet phoenix will underperform with sub win rate izzet phoenix has been the deck in modern for while now the deck is essentially fair with number of great interactive elements but also presents the possible explosive potential of multiple arclight phoenix es attacking on turn two or flipped awoken horror attack on turn three that raw power is necessary to compete in modern add that to the fact that the deck is so consistent and interactive and it not hard to see why it so popular however izzet phoenix tends to struggle against chalice of the void and good removal for thing in the ice backed by graveyard hate when decks are packing cards like fatal push then thing in the ice starts to look unimpressive and if they can keep your arclight phoenix in check you become extremely reliant on aria of flame to actually win games with jund and eldrazi tron looking to be very popular and tough matchups like hogaak and grixis urza looming izzet phoenix does not look poised for great weekend modern across the pond am writing this sitting at the airport waiting to board my flight to barcelona and pretty amped to battle am strongly considering modern goblins list very similar to last week video and am hoping pull the trigger how will do how will the predictions turn out we shall see
let face it hogaak the arisen necropolis has not had very friendly introduction to the modern format it terrorized us all for few weeks ultimately leading to bridge from below being banned in modern and creating an immediate first impression of inciting groans however what if we played hogaak bit more fairly pro tour champ steve rubin recently ed magic online league with very interesting take on hogaak rather than use it in some broken graveyard engine steve was instead using it as powerful endgame threat in deck designed to strip each player of all of their resources smallpox is an extremely powerful card that has been in modern for long time but decks that play it often have trouble closing the game out before their opponent can draw their way back into the game hogaak attempts to solve that problem time stamps match match match match match hogaak pox modern steve rubin creatures hogaak arisen necropolis bloodghast cabal therapist pack rat stitcher supplier planeswalkers liliana of the veil instants fatal push sorceries inquisition of kozilek smallpox thoughtseize lands snow covered swamp dryad arbor marsh flats mutavault nurturing peatland verdant catacombs urborg tomb of yawgmoth sideboard plague engineer liliana triumph fatal push liliana the last hope fulminator mage bitterblossom leyline of the void buy this deck export text format unfortunately our slate of matchups today wasn too great for us wrenn and six is huge problem for us as it is able to invalidate our liliana of the veil and smallpox plan while graveyard decks aren going to be easy either without leyline of the void still there definite potential here cabal therapist impressed and bloodghast provides the fuel to the decks fire by making every card work better the deck also had an interesting sideboard plan of removing most of the graveyard based elements to try and beat graveyard hate but while the plan is good the exact threats themselves do need some tweaking either way it fun and exciting new take on an old and popular archetype if you love smallpox as much as do this is an excellent place to start
how one views the cards from new set depends lot on how they like to play magic if you re standard player it all about finding the cards that stand out and figuring out where they fit in the big picture of the format for modern or legacy players it much more difficult as the barrier for entry is so high that only few scant cards from new sets really make mark if you re limited player there lot to be excited about cloudkin seer holy cow the more formats you play the wider your lens needs to be for viewing how each card from new set fits into the focus of each particular format as someone who plays all the competitive formats both seriously in tournaments and for bit more fun on stream and in content get to wear lot of hats and look at cards in many different ways however there one more hat in my closet and that is of cube designer which requires whole new set of criteria on how to judge cards when designing cube it less about is this card good and more about does this card help create healthy and fun environment for what my cube is trying to do evaluating cube cards is very challenging but also what makes building cube fun as such today we are going to look over core set and modern horizons for what they ve got to contribute to cube core set your average set doesn often add too many cards to cube even less so when it core set with number of reprints that have already been available to cube designers the bar is very high and sets can only be so powerful as we ll see bit later this trend is broken by modern horizons but that whole different story core set doesn have bunch of cards that are too exciting for cube but it does have few possible role players the first place to look for new cube card is in the drops because that the place with the least competition in cube there are million great drops that could go in cube but only so many good drops knight of the ebon legion is very solid as we ve seen in standard but unfortunately his vampire creature type doesn matter at all in cube still he durable drop that scales well into the late game and offers an aggro deck reasonable mana sink he not flashy but when your competition is vampire lacerator and tormented hero it not too hard to make mark verdict likely addition let keep the one drop train rolling elvish reclaimer seems tailor built for cube play it features reasonable size body that can size up pretty quickly in world of fetchlands while also featuring tutor effect which is always desirable attribute in cube there are multitude of awesome lands available which makes elvish reclaimer ability to cast crop rotation over and over again very useful one that can facilitate fun deck building don know exactly what you want to do with elvish reclaimer but know there are many interesting possibilities the issue is that there needs to be home for elvish reclaimer what deck wants this effect if your cube contains some sort of lands or lands matter theme elvish reclaimer will fit right in but as card that isn just universally good there needs to be consideration for placement just like you wouldn put goblin ringleader into cube with only three other goblins elvish reclaimer needs job to do verdict in if it has clear purpose one more drop ve already waxed poetic about spectral sailor but the reality is that it is lot of value for one mana while blue aggressive decks are not usually well supported in most cubes spectral sailor can also make some waves as cheap card draw engine for control decks that plays very well with the bevy of great counterspells in the cube the issues here are if there are enough decks that will actively want spectral sailor and also the extremely high barrier of entry into any cube blue section still it unique effect on cheap creature in color with very few good cheap creatures just can resist the best azure mage of all time verdict it will be tried while the barrier for entry for one drops is very low the barrier for entry for planeswalkers is very high one of the most common and egregious cube design mistakes is including far too many planeswalkers which has dramatic influence over the gameplay of the cube you stop being able to make all sorts of different decks and everyone just ends up with midrange planeswalker pile chandra acolyte of flame is sweet magic card with lot going on token generation can be wholly aggressive or do other interesting things with sacrifice outlets and the lot while flashing back spells is also very cool sadly she just isn better than the other planeswalker options meaning she should probably only make the cut in very large cubes or cubes that heavily promote theme she is invested in verdict falls just short yes know golos tireless pilgrim looks more like fun casual card than serious cube card however one half of primeval titan that any color can cast for five mana is actually very good effect as we said about elvish reclaimer there are tons of great lands to get and golos gets them at decent rate with good sized body furthermore golos activated ability is kinda wild and fun but ultimately very powerful thing to build toward it might be little crazy but the thought of being able to fetch up tolarian academy or maze of ith while also adding really fun and flashy endgame puzzle sounds appealing to me verdict just crazy enough to work for the most part that all core set has to offer quick word on the omissions mythic planeswalkers the planeswalkers in core set are all well designed but too narrow in scope and power level for cube play unless your cube has very specific vampire or life gain theme there just aren good enough cavaliers the cavalier cycle pales in comparison to other options at five mana they re embarrassing next to the titan cycle and don bring much to cube three color legends the barrier for three colored cards in cube is almost unbreakable and while kethis the hidden hand and friends are reasonably powered they are narrow in scope when you re already extremely hard to cast you need to be big payoff every single time core set is pretty normal in regards to what it adds to the cube card pool however modern horizons is something else entirely modern horizons oh boy modern horizons is wreaking havoc across both modern and legacy and it makes lot of sense that the set full of cards too good for standard would be jam packed full of power while most sets have small handful of potential cards modern horizons has boatload with number of must adds as well let start with the big one wrenn and six is just busted while also having fun build around me theme that can help give more identity to green and red as color pair it loves being paired with fetchlands cycling lands wasteland and all sorts of other land themed effects bringing with it an extremely high power level the ability to interact with all sorts of early creatures and game altering ultimate wrenn and six may be the best card in modern horizons verdict should be in every cube another easy one fetchlands are great color fixing is great put this in your cube verdict should be in every cube hexdrinker is overhyped in modern and legacy it essentially just savannah lion with mild upside which is fine but very unexciting however as we said earlier there much lower bar in cube for good drops and hexdrinker fits the bill perfectly there aren ton of great aggressive one drops in green that aren just mana creatures so hexdrinker gets to fill nice niche at good power level with solid floor and big ceiling that lot of value for one mana especially for card that scales so well into the late game it not wham bam slam dunk like wrenn and six but hexdrinker should be in most cubes verdict should be in most cubes slam dunk after slam dunk there isn really question that the horizon canopy lands should be in the cube they re color fixing and they re great the big question becomes what to do with them because there are only six of them which is really awkward number if you re trying to keep your cube uniform ve always had one set of ten multicolored lands in my cube that encompassed one land for each color pair from various cycles you want to have creeping tar pit in your cube but don want to have lavaclaw reaches you want to have simic growth chamber but not boros garrison etc here where be currently creeping tar pit celestial colonnade horizon canopy kessig wolf run temple of malice sunbaked canyon firey islet simic growth chamber golgari rot farm silent clearing still like having few bounce lands for the turbo lands style decks and will be working forward with this configuration to start it important to consider what each color combination wants to be doing when the full cycle of horizon canopy lands is here it will end up just having its own ten card cycle slot and we will figure something else out for the oddball lands verdict most to all should be in all cubes okay we ve got the easy stuff out of the way let get to one of the most complicated issues snow in cube there aren that many snow cards that actually matter meaning there may be half dozen total cards in the cube that will care about the word snow however if you stop thinking about snow mana being snow mana and start thinking about it just being basic lands matter things become much clearer you could easily make all basics in your cube snow covered lands which immediately adds more value and interest to playing basics to help turn on cards like dead of winter and friends the question becomes are these cards powerful enough only triggering off basics even card like icehide golem offers cube worthy rate if paid with snow mana but is needing to play lot of basics enough of turn off that they won see play my gut says they are too awkward but they are fun cards that make you value your basic lands in unique way so they are definitely worth trying anything that makes you actively want to play basic lands and adds tension to how you build your decks is win in my book verdict worth trying but may not be worth the trouble while he many have terrorized modern for while there hogaak is actually pretty cool card once you take bridge from below and fully refined modern deck out of the picture cube decks don routinely put power into play on turn two meaning hogaak needs to be played fairly and worked for which is exactly what want to see from my cube cards if every card is jace the mind sculptor lightning bolt or treachery then it just becomes my good cards against your good cards cards like hogaak inspire your drafters to take trip down certain deck building path make hard deck building and drafting choices while having to alter how they value cards and ultimately lead to great gameplay experience verdict unless you hate synergy hogaak slots well into golgari slot okay on the one hand we re always on the lookout for good cube drops on the other hand try to avoid extreme redundancy whenever possible the cube can only be so big and by having both armageddon and ravages of war you re wasting slot on card that could be something more unique there are outliners to this for cheap effects that define color lightning bolt chain lightning birds of paradise llanowar elves thoughtseize inquisition of kozilek but for the most part try to avoid it especially on powerful or unique effects mother of runes qualifies as powerful and unique effect to the point of almost being annoying yes giver of runes is the fixed mother of runes and is still very good card but having both doesn feel right verdict only in if you cut mother of runes or your cube is huge another sweet tutor and synergy card sign me up the fixed love child of goblin welder and stoneforge mystic goblin engineer brings lot of power to the table but doesn risk unfun things like turn two sundering titan or blightsteel colossus you get to put together whatever artifact synergies you want while also getting to do the goblin welder thing of swapping stuff back and forth for value over and over again which is sweet too only see good things when see goblin engineer verdict if you have an artifact theme goblin engineer fits great one of the hardest things with handling red in your cube is finding more interesting things for it to do than just attack and lava spike people many cubes have this problem as if you just take the best red card in any draft you end up with cohesive deck because they all do the same thing variety is very important goblin engineer helps to do that as does magmatic sinkhole most removal spells in red also double as burn spells meaning you can just pile them up and kill your opponent magmatic sinkhole gives red very good removal spell that is going to be good against almost all of your opponents and can also answer things that red typically struggles with higher toughness creatures and high loyalty planeswalkers having more answers to planeswalkers in your cube is goal you should have anyway making magmatic sinkhole slam dunk verdict should be in every cube reasonable body reasonable ability tutor effect card advantage in white props up drops all those things sound great to me ranger captain of eos is card that does lot and can be played as an aggressive card or value card while also helping to pull together certain things if that is what you re looking for there aren many drops better verdict should be in every cube if undead augur was in standard it would be one of the best drops in the format that can replace itself for only two mana is already great but undead augur is so much more when paired with other zombies that things can start to get out of hand tribal themes don go too far in my cube but there are light human and zombie themes which really help to give more of an identity to fast aggressive decks just jamming garbage like vampire lacerator rarely works which is why black aggro is often maligned in cubes but when you top off your gravecrawler and carrion feeder with something like undead augur good things start to happen cryptbreaker is another great early creature that does lot of unique things that fits the theme verdict should inspire light zombie theme even in your non tribal cube seasoned pyromancer is just the right kind of cube card yes it is powerful card in vacuum it grinds well scales well into the late game provides card advantage and gives you mana sink once it dead but if it was just another good fair card only be mildly excited the great part about seasoned pyromancer is that it gives graveyard decks an excellent and powerful way to get cards in the graveyard for good value maybe you re playing fair and discarding lingering souls or maybe you re thinking bigger and it griselbrand either way seasoned pyromancer gets to be more than the sum of its parts while not forcing the synergy decks to play with subpar enablers seasoned pyromancer is great verdict should be in most cubes there more these are all the modern horizons cards feel can make the cube in most cubes are there more cards worth talking about absolutely but it important to recognize that any card that costs four or more mana has extremely heavy competition and good cube cards need to be castable flexible and hopefully create meaningful gameplay and drafting deck building choices if there are any other cards you would like to see discussed please post them in the comments and ll do my best to address them otherwise happy cubing
everyone knows how upset was when goblin ringleader wasn in modern horizons it felt like the perfect card for modern everyone loves tribal decks great nostalgia and realistically mana spell that draws cards is never going to be broken yet modern horizons came and went and while we got goblin matron we didn get her favorite target enter core set while it true we don have the mana denial element present in legacy with wasteland and rishadan port for the most part all the tools are here recent reprints of skirk prospector and goblin warchief join the party giving us the entire lineup minus gempalm incinerator and goblin lackey goblin lackey is relic of the past power level anyway and in lieu of gempalm incinerator we have the new munitions expert doesn do as well for card advantage but can pick off planeswalkers so let do it time stamps match match match match match vial goblins modern jim davis creatures goblin chainwhirler goblin cratermaker pashalik mons siege gang commander sling gang lieutenant goblin piledriver munitions expert knucklebone witch goblin matron goblin ringleader goblin warchief mogg war marshal skirk prospector instants tarfire artifacts aether vial lands mutavault blood crypt auntie hovel bloodstained mire cavern of souls field of ruin snow covered swamp snow covered mountain sideboard earwig squad goblin trashmaster warren weirding zo zu the punisher relic of progenitus munitions expert thoughtseize grafdigger cage buy this deck export text format wow that was impressive full disclosure expected to have fun time with some old friends in this video didn expect that we would through gauntlet that represented good portion of the modern metagame the truth is that modern is in pretty fair place right now and goblins slots into that metagame very well goblin ringleader gives goblins one of the best card draw engines in the format while the deck still has the speed to deal with linear decks when necessary remember this very important fact goblins is not an aggro deck goblins can kill quickly but you re better off thinking of it as synergy based board control deck that ready to strike but always geared up for long game the new cards impressed with munitions expert ability to hit planewalkers making it live in almost every matchup more maindeck are probably wanted sling gang lieutenant felt gimmicky going in but gives the deck the very unique effects of both fireballing your opponent as well as gaining life when needed pashalik mons was fine but unexciting the most important advice can give is look for your path into the long game and don be too cute with your one ofs there are tons of goblins that are good small percentage of the time but you see lot of your cards every game and you can afford to draw stingscourger or lightning crafter at the wrong time otherwise may your top four cards always contain four goblins
wilderness reclamation untapping azcanta the sunken ruin nissa who shakes the world fueling huge hydroid krasis heroic reinforcements giving haste to the second history of benalia token runaway steam kin fueling massive experimental frenzy turns in the later stages of standard format we tend to take for granted some of the clever card pairings that make up the format best decks once they ve been firmly established we just accept them as what they are and forget about the parts that make up the whole however at some point early in the format player or players had the idea to try them together and it gelled so well that it became cornerstone of the format trying to find those pairings in new format is vitally important if you want to be ahead of the game as the first few weeks of new standard format is the time period where you can gain the largest edge possible in constructed format so let take look at what core set has to offer and try and find the next great pairing of cards we utilized this combo in our video monday alongside the guildgates and their associated payoffs but realistically you can play scapeshift and field of the dead in almost any deck as big combo finish seven lands in play nets you seven zombies and it scales up exceedingly well once you throw in second copy of field of the dead furthermore each additional land drop will net you another zombie or two making this one of the premier endgames in the format one card combos don exist very often in standard but that exactly what scapeshift promises you if you can just get those first seven lands in play just like in modern this can be via ramp spells or by just playing longer game there are some deck building costs associated with making sure you have the proper number of unique land types but playing random gainland or temple isn the end of the world you can even milk some value out of it by playing cards like field of ruin blast zone or arch of orazca scapeshift and field of the dead won be legal together for very long but they will certainly be fixture together for as long as they are there no doubt that risen reef is one of the most powerful and hyped cards in core set with many new decks trying to abuse it power it is being compared to rogue refiner but risen reef has an astoundingly higher ceiling than rogue refiner could ever dream rogue refiner is nice value card but risen reef is engine the big question of course is how to run the engine is it okay to just play risen reef alongside few other elementals like leafkin druid and wildgrowth walker do you want to go all the way with full elemental theme do we branch out into more colors what cards play best with risen reef to answer the last one we have another one of the more exciting cards in core set chandra acolyte of flame risen reef adds draw two cards and play lands for free to chandra middle loyalty ability which amounts to an obscene amount of value add this to the fact that chandra is great three mana planeswalker and you ve got very interesting duo chandra requires certain amount of cheap spells to get full value and finding room in your elemental deck for that can be tough but the synergy here is undeniable speaking of chandra making and sacrificing two creature tokens turn falls right in line with everything rakdos aristocrats deck has ever wanted to do you can sacrifice them both to priest of forgotten gods pump them with judith the scourge diva sacrifice them to plaguecrafter and more with perhaps the most exciting combo being mayhem devil adding on free forked bolt every turn once again chandra is already good card and adding on these sorts of extra synergies is what takes card from good to great rakdos sacrifice based decks have been on the fringes of standard for while now but it possible that chandra could be what it takes to push them over the edge there no doubt that risen reef and nissa who shakes the world are two of the most powerful cards in standard right now each one creates an insurmountable advantage if it is left to its own devices but each is also hard to answer profitably in modern white decks get to turn to suite of powerful hate bears to turn off what decks want to do thalia guardian of thraben gaddock teeg meddling mage ethersworn canonist the list goes on and on well what if told you standard has some hate bears too tomik distinguished advokist and tocatli honor guard both help to answer each of the aforementioned cards in their own way while also being difficult for typical simic decks to kill tomik removes the ability for nissa to make any creatures while being very well costed attacker while tocatli honor guard is weaker overall but much more devastating for the elemental package as well as the explore package wow jim play sorin imperious bloodlord with other vampires that the groundbreaking strategy advice then pay you the big bucks for okay stop sassing and listen to me for minute yes sorin is great card and plays very well with vampires champion of dusk is powerful vampire payoff card that was always little too expensive to be worth playing put them together though and you ve got match made in heaven or wherever vampires usually hang out however the important thing to note here is what this pairing does for the vampire archetype as whole typically vampires was just seen as beatdown deck similar to white weenie you play drops you pump them up and you attack some of the most successful vampire decks even played venerated loxodon further displaying the white weenie connection however the introduction of champion of dusk the potential for massive card advantage and the flexibility and power of sorin have taken vampires far beyond just mindless tribal deck there more method to the madness and new vampire decks need to be built with this in mind with such great card advantage engine there isn need to try and blitz opponents out with drops and cards like legion lieutenant may be more of liability than is necessary now don just add new cards to existing decks think about how new cards can fundamentally alter what an old deck is trying to do speaking of new cards altering what an old deck can do remember the sweet golgari dredge deck that was floating around for while it was packed to the brim with self mill cards like glowspore shaman and stitcher supplier while trying to get paid off with some undergrowth effects and looping molderhulk and memorial to folly the problem was it did lot of wheel spinning and not lot of interacting just to get few blood for bones may just change that blood for bones is great value card but it can be more if you put in the work sacrificing stitcher supplier to bring back jadelight ranger to your hand and molderhulk to play is fantastic value play but blood for bones also opens up world of potential endgame power as well with lotleth giant golgari dredge decks used to play one copy of lotleth giant to try and dig up with memorial to folly and cast in the late game but that was very convoluted and expensive play now we can do it for four mana with card that already good with the rest of the deck it may not make golgari dredge good enough but blood for bones is powerful card that shouldn be overlooked every time an omniscience is put into the battlefield off of flood of tears an angel gets its wings the thing is it isn actually that crazy there lot of murmuring going around about flood of tears being breakout card this weekend at scg tour worcester the first standard event of the new format and much of it is on the back of the fact that omniscience was inexplicably in core set with standard simic ramp decks trying constantly to outdo each other with the biggest possible endgame currently mass manipulation for six omniscience certainly presents the most absolute endgame imaginable simic flood standard pykapower magic online league creatures arboreal grazer leafkin druid risen reef planeswalkers jace wielder of mysteries narset parter of veils tamiyo collector of tales sorceries overflowing insight flood of tears enchantments gift of paradise omniscience urban utopia lands forest island blast zone breeding pool hinterland harbor temple of mystery sideboard healer of the glade negate nezahal primal tide nissa who shakes the world sorcerous spyglass spell pierce buy this deck export text format export arena format yes this is deck that went in magic online league it not that hard to figure out that if you get an omniscience onto the battlefield you should be able to win but with tamiyo collector of tales able to infinitely re buy flood of tears you get to reuse all of your planeswalkers and risen reef as many times as you want ultimately cumulating in jace wielder of mysteries kill this may eventually be proven to be too soft and non interactive for standard but the memo is out that flood of tears is real magic card top pair top kicker of course even if you find the killer pair of cards in standard there has to be deck to go along with them as well core set promises to shake up standard in big way hopefully throwing wrench into esper teferi fest that dominated the tail end of the previous format not only are many of the new cards specifically good against teferi time raveler but the power level of core set is high enough that things should be mighty interesting mighty quick excited and you should be too
when scapeshift was reprinted in core set it felt like purely financial reprint while scapeshift has proven to be popular and on and off successful card in modern the card served little to no purpose in standard well that is until now of course core set brings with it field of the dead valakut the molten pinnacle for new day singlehandedly bringing scapeshift out of the rare binder and into the game as serious player in new standard with seven lands in play scapeshift grants you seven zombies and with eight or more lands in play things start to get really out of hand the with different names clause creates some unique deck building tension but fortunately we already had ramp deck in standard that played bunch of different lands mash it all together and you ve got gate shift time stamps match match match match match gate shift core set standard jim davis creatures archway angel elvish rejuvenator hydroid krasis golos tireless pilgrim arboreal grazer instants growth spiral sorceries circuitous route gates ablaze scapeshift enchantments guild summit lands forest azorius guildgate boros guildgate golgari guildgate selesnya guildgate stomping ground temple of mystery breeding pool field of the dead gruul guildgate izzet guildgate plaza of harmony simic guildgate sideboard arch of orazca deafening clarion legion warboss chandra awakened inferno teferi time raveler negate archway angel buy this deck export text format export arena format melding scapeshift with the traditional gates shell is almost no brainer pairing together the new combo some of the best ramp in the format backed by powerful payoffs like gates ablaze and guild summit some memey gates decks actually played scapeshift previously just for lot of guild summit triggers but now we ve got real reason to play the card and guild summit is just bonus gates ablaze is one of the best sweepers in the format and when your opponent is feeling the pressure of an impending combo and is trying to kill you quickly mana sweeper is exactly what you want gates ablaze is also great against nissa who shakes the world and the whole deck is fairly resistant to teferi time raveler golos tireless pilgrim is also another huge addition to the deck playing the role of primeval titan as well as late game mana sink golos is huge hard to kill blocker than can directly get you field of the dead so you can start naturally making zombies without needing to cast scapeshift this deck may look like meme but some form of scapeshift combo is likely to be one of the best decks in standard for the few months that scapeshift and field of the dead are legal together this is certainly the first step but the grafting of an amazing combo onto an already proven deck is great place to start
warning the decks you are about to see are mostly untested first drafts they were played live on steam this monday as my first stab at the new core set standard format most are brews jam packed with new core set cards while there are few updates to existing archetypes with new core set twists but it important to note that these are first steps and not finished products use them as stepping stones for your own deck brewing process but play them card for card at your own risk with that out of the way let get started core set is one of the most interesting sets in while in that it provides bunch of fun new cards for us to parse and play with but also bunch of help to previous standard themes that never quite got there like dinosaurs vampires goblins and more because of the help it gives to themes that had previously fell short the set ends up feeling much bigger than it actually is because it makes all of those old cards playable in addition to all of the new cards it brings as such this is very interesting time to brew today we re going over all ten decks played on stream monday briefly going over each list and my thoughts on how it was giving it letter grade and talking about what kind of potential it has going forward played five to six games with each deck in best of one so the deck record will be included as well let go goblins goblins core set standard jim davis first draft creatures krenko tin street kingpin ember hauler volley veteran fanatical firebrand wily goblin goblin chainwhirler goblin instigator goblin ringleader goblin warchief siege gang commander skirk prospector artifacts icon of ancestry lands mountain buy this deck export text format export arena format deck grade deck potential medium where else would start goblins was at very odd place in standard with dominaria reintroducing skirk prospector goblin warchief and siege gang commander to format with very little other support for the tribe there wasn enough meat for full deck and goblin chainwhirler the best goblin in the format didn require any help and was an active deterrent to putting bunch of in your deck there just wasn enough of payoff for putting bunch of goblins into your deck well now there is while notably absent from modern horizons goblin ringeader makes surprising appearance in core set as one of the best tribal incentives in long time goblin ringleader cares very much about how many goblins are in your deck while also giving you huge payoff for making that number as high as possible with goblin ringleader joining siege gang commander goblins in standard certainly has the ability to grind with the best of them and the new icon of ancestry further pushes the power level providing boost to your many and even more late game draw power the issue is that your one and drops are lacking which means you can fall behind before goblin ringleader can really get you going wily goblin just isn good enough and while the new ember hauler is passable the deck is lacking in the early game still icon of ancestry is great and goblin ringleader provides ton of cards and is great against planeswalkers there definitely something here temur elementals temur elementals core set standard jim davis first draft creatures chandra embercat cloudkin seer leafkin druid omnath locus of the roil risen reef planeswalkers chandra novice pyromancer chandra awakened inferno chandra acolyte of flame instants shock sorceries fight with fire jaya immolating inferno lands mountain breeding pool steam vents rootbound crag stomping ground temple of epiphany unclaimed territory buy this deck export text format export arena format deck grade deck potential very high from an old classic to the new school elementals are the tribe of core set with this deck featuring almost primarily cards from the new set they look weird but the elemental crew led by the seemingly innocent risen reef creates quite the engine they make lot of incidental mana quickly which leads to some fast starts topped off with omnath locus of the roil and many chandras risen reef guarantees value immediately but if it allowed to live the advantage in both cards and mana it creates is astounding the other element of the elemental deck is how well it plays with multiple chandras chandra acolyte of flame is probably the best chandra in the format and using her token generation ability to power up risen reef is dream come true she also pressures planeswalkers and allows you to flash back spells which we will get to later chandra awakened inferno is quite the top end throwing emblems at slower decks while sweeping up other creature decks chandra novice pyromancer was surprisingly effective but may not be good enough you need to have some interaction beyond omnath and also want spells for chandra acolyte of flame to flash back leading us to some burn spells the idea was to use spells that could be flashed back later for lot of mana and while jaya immolating inferno was impressive fight with fire was just too much mana to be reliable having access to shock for spot removal felt very important this deck has long way to go before it hits its final form but there something serious here dinosaurs dinosaurs core set standard jim davis first draft creatures carnage tyrant raptor hatchling shifting ceratops llanowar elves marauding raptor ranging raptors regisaur alpha ripjaw raptor instants shock sorceries savage stomp commune with dinosaurs lands forest mountain rootbound crag stomping ground buy this deck export text format deck grade deck potential low to medium dinosaurs was one of the biggest flops from ixalan as the tribe never really made it past it few key cards being played in non dinosaur decks there just wasn enough synergy to go around and enrage was only really good against other red and green decks marauding raptor certainly is the shot in the arm that dinosaurs needed covering basically every single problem the deck had it good worthwhile early creature that provides mana acceleration scales well into the late game and makes enrage relevant mechanic curving turn two marauding raptor into turn three ripjaw raptor is awesome and marauding raptor breathes new life into cards like ranging raptors and raptor hatchling however that really it as far as upgrades go shifting ceratops is okay but just more of the same leaving dinosaurs slightly better deck than it was but still aggressively mediocre if dinosaurs is going to succeed it probably just going to be few of the new cards tacked into the charging monstrosaur gruul deck that has been floating around vampires vampires core set standard jim davis first draft creatures elenda the dusk rose mavren fein dusk apostle oathsworn vampire champion of dusk sanctum seeker knight of the ebon legion adanto vanguard dusk legion zealot legion lieutenant vicious conquistador planeswalkers sorin vengeful bloodlord sorin imperious bloodlord instants cast down enchantments legion landing lands plains swamp godless shrine isolated chapel unclaimed territory buy this deck export text format export arena format deck grade deck potential high another ixalan tribe that never really got off the ground vampires was always bit short in the power level department there just weren enough reasons to put bunch of vampires in your deck boy has that changed wowzers is sorin imperious bloodlord amazing sorin singlehandedly breathes life into the archetype providing basically anything you could ever want in your vampire deck for an easy to cast three mana investment sorin helps to buff your creatures and push them through blockers gains life kills creatures kills planeswalkers kills players is very durable and can even put things into play for free it hard to undersell how much power sorin brings to the table sorin also props up some very powerful vampires that were always just little too high on the curve to be super effective champion of dusk is powerful payoff for putting vampires into your deck but five mana was lot to ask for card that wasn great if you were behind how about putting champion of dusk into play on turn three while also adding planeswalker to the board sanctum seeker is similar having huge effect on the board while also being reasonable to cast when you don have sorin the exact mix of threats will need to be figured out as you can go too crazy with the bigger vampires and have your deck not function when you don draw sorin but sorin singlehandedly makes vampires thing in standard karn and friends karn and friends core set standard

actually very powerful mana creature for artifacts but while it joins powerful artifact enablers like sai master thopterist and karn scion of urza there just aren enough reasonable artifacts to fill out full decklist the idea was to use karn the great creator as sort of artifact factory allowing you to pull out whatever artifacts you needed from your sideboard to make up for the relative lack of reasonable artifacts in the main deck but the deck completely lacked in both speed and interaction we couldn stop our opponent from executing their game plan and our game plan just wasn powerful

maw of flames is unbelievably powerful if it gets chance to attack and utilizing the haste aspect of bond of revival with drakuseth provided us with an incredibly potent combo not much instant speed removal can kill drakuseth before it gets to attack and even if our opponents were able to remove drakuseth on their next turn their board was often decimated with tamiyo collector of tales fueling the graveyard and allowing us to re buy whatever we need it wasn hard to reset up for another bond of revival attack the following turn with so few cards necessary to facilitate the combo the rest of the deck is essentially just sultai midrange good stuff deck that is already packed full of interaction tomebound lich is another fantastic new card for the deck providing looting effect to get drakuseth into the graveyard while also playing defense against the aggro decks and offense against the slower decks this deck was impressive mardu angels mardu angels core set standard jim davis

vigilance that draws you good card rather than ground that draws you random card with some energy naturally she harder to cast but there lot of power there worth building around bishop of wings also gave the deck the drop it always wanted providing great blocker life buffer and some insurance if your angels die overall the deck felt very midrangy and didn fare too well but if the format is right

standard plus field of the dead is going to provide you with an absurd advantage creating anywhere from to ish zombie tokens out of nowhere while also providing you with additional zombies for each

chandras and very powerful chandra themed artifact sends everything into overdrive chandra acolyte of flame is phenomenal pressuring planeswalkers and flashing back removal spells but also helping to up the loyalty on all of your planeswalkers at once chandra awakened inferno drops in at the top end to mop up small creatures or put your opponent in the emblem fix chandra regulator was surprisingly effective not only for doubling up on abilities but giving the mono red deck the ability to control its draw step for very reasonable cost sarkhan the masterless and saheeli sublime artificer have already proven their worth in planeswalker centric decks making this deck great collection of removal and proven threats it can sit back and kill stuff and control the game to an extent but has no problem turning the corner and winning quickly when needed sarkhan saheeli and chandra acolyte of flame all do good job at pressuring enemy planeswalker as well this is one to watch azorius fliers

evasive clock as well as the ability to play sephara sky blade fairly early as well spectral sailor and loyal pegasus were also very nice additions to the drop slot the problem was that in five games only one opponent actually killed one of our creatures making this result look lot better than it is when facing no interaction this deck is going to kill very quickly but the fear is that the individual power level of our cards is too low once things start getting picked apart sephara sky blade looks mighty foolish when your first three creatures get killed venerated loxodon also didn really play out as expected as our flying creatures didn want to take turn off to get larger and they didn need to get larger because there were no blockers to get through if you re looking to dunk on

it feels like war of the spark just came out last week and modern horizons came out yesterday but here we are getting ready for another big shakeup in standard core set is here bringing with it bunch of new toys for standard one of the most intriguing things about the set is how heavily it props up the unsuccessful ixalan themes with lot of support for tribes like vampires and dinosaurs it is great to see those tribes get the help but ixalan rotates in few months still we ve got quite the collection of tools for decks old and new so let get started here are my loves and hates for core set love sorin imperious bloodlord look know tribal based planeswalkers haven done very well historically yeah grabbing nissa chosen or two with nissa revane was all right but liliana untouched by death was downright embarrassing here to tell you that sorin imperious bloodlord is different very different for starters three mana is much less than four sorin is easy to cast and comes down early while also going right up to five loyalty if needed this is very important made even more obvious by the fact that standard is currently defined by three mana planeswalker that can start on five loyalty but while sorin is much more restrictive than teferi time raveler there is still lot of power there yes you must play bunch of vampires to make sorin work but the payoff is huge sorin makes your vampires bigger pushes them through blockers gains life so you can race and afford more adanto vanguard activations and is repeatable removal spell for creatures planeswalkers and players that is lot of value for only mana and those are just the plus abilities the ability won be used nearly as often but being able to put more things on the board even if it just another adanto vanguard is powerful option to have while you need to go to modern to put anything absurd into play show and tell style something like champion of dusk is powerful curve topper in standard and would be excellent on turn three sorin singlehandedly makes vampires playable deck in standard hate mu yanling sky dancer three mana planeswalkers are usually great but they can all be great mu yanling sky dancer slides into the flying matters theme present in core set but fails because of how few options it presents you while sorin can pump up your different creatures target all sorts of things and put things into play the turn you cast it mu yanling does one thing she gives an opponent creature and makes it lose flying that is all she can do the turn you cast her and that simply not good enough mu yanling is often going to play as three mana suspend make flying token and in world of teferi time raveler bounces and abundant removal that not even close to good enough she could see some sideboard play out of blue aggressive decks against control decks just by virtue of being non creature threat against removal heavy decks but that because planeswalkers are just good in general not because she is good mu yanling is total miss love lightning stormkin lightning stormkin is not world beater it not teferi time raveler or nissa who shakes the world it not card that defines format nor card that makes the game completely revolve around it rather lightning stormkin is blue collar magic card it shows up to every game ready to put in the work gets along well with all of your other cards and wants to clock out at the end of the day knowing it did its part as best it could it probably shares lunch break with paradise druid skymarcher aspirant elite guardmage and viashino pyromancer where they all talk about grabbing beer at happy hour when the tournament is over and maybe watching some twitch tv at the bar it easy to ignore cards like lightning stormkin but identifying them early makes deck building for new format much easier haste flier for two mana is excellent but lightning stormkin goes beyond that by providing two relevant creature types as well as possibly touching the flying matters theme as well don forget wizard lightning and adeliz the cinder wind are still legal in standard and izzet wizards decks have been on the edge of playability for while now lightning stormkin may just be the cog they need to work without job to do lightning stormkin may end up unemployed but the grit and hard work is there waiting for someone to pick it up hate omnath locus of the roil this card couldn have cost three mana at its floor omnath locus of the roil is difficult to cast hill giant that deals one damage to creature when it enters the battlefield and landfalls to be little bit bigger that hardly playable in limited let alone worth the absurd mana cost in constructed clearly omnath is meant to be played with other elementals in tribal style deck but the issues here are numerous omnath barely compares favorably to volley veteran card that has seen no play in much better single color tribe furthermore omnath doesn really reward you for playing bunch of elementals beyond his enters the battlefield trigger if his landfall trigger gave all elementals counter maybe we could talk more but it likely still not worth the investment of four color intensive mana for omnath is clunky expensive fragile and unexciting elementals are going to need to do lot better than this if they re going to be anything worth playing love lotus field lotus field scares me at face value lotus field isn really worth the trouble while there isn really anything in standard that could punish you for putting all your eggs in one basket lotus field is awkward to use because you get all mana in one lump monochromatic sum this makes it tough to use as manafixer because while it taps for any color most multicolored decks are interested in cards like nicol bolas the ravager not goblin chainwhirler so you really need to be doing something more with lotus field to be getting good value out of it and something more is going to mean tapping it more than once turn there are two very good ways to do so in standard at the moment teferi hero of dominaria and kiora behemoth beckoner teferi is the better of the two in vacuum but leaves you limited to only casting instants with your extra lotus field mana kiora however is something else entirely if you play kiora on turn three when you play lotus field on turn four you ll have access to mana that turn and mana the next that lot of mana in very short time frame without having to rely on fragile mana creatures this is big deal add this to the fact that this combo can fit into any deck with green or blue mana and you ve got quite the engine watch out for lotus field hate cavalier of gales wizards of the coast really likes to make big cycle of mythic rares in core sets we started with primeval titan and friends which was bit too far over the mark then saw soul of innistrad and friends which was quite bit below the mark and most recently saw the tri colored elder dragon legends in core set more casual staples than constructed powerhouses well the core set cycle is the cavaliers and they look much like their nba namesake does without lebron james embarrassing while they do have some immediate effect when they are played brainstorm or beast within hardly compare to moan of the unhallowed or arc lightning and unlike the titans they don threaten to single handedly take over the game once they attack lastly the cavaliers also fail the teferi test the enters the battlefield triggers aren nearly worth their costs meaning that teferi just embarrasses them cavalier of gales is the best of the set and doesn stack up well next to god eternal kefnet just like lebron james ll take pass on these cavaliers love hanged executioner another solid role player hanged executioner is very nice little package for three mana essentially just the front half of lingering souls hanged executioner comes with nice little rider text that allows you to exile an opponent creature this ability will not be used super often but the existence of it will dramatically change how your opponents have to play their games think about how good it feels when your opponent uses removal spell on your lingering souls token and then realize that hanged executioner is card that incentivizes your opponent to do just that that great being spirit is also surprisingly relevant as it easy to forget that supreme phantom is still standard legal magic card and of course flying matters is also theme in core set and two fliers for three mana with upside is pretty good favorable winds is still legal as well as new cards like winged words and empyrean eagle hanged executioner is simple and effective fan hate leylines yes all of them why do they keep printing more leylines it has to be one of the worst mechanics ever and they re rarely playable except in extreme scenarios where you need leyline of the void or leyline of sanctity to defend against early game degeneracy the opportunity cost of putting leylines into your deck is so high because they are never even close to worth four mana so you end up with card that is okay if it is in your opening hand and basically uncastable if you draw it literally any time after that it an awful gameplay experience and yet they keep going back for more would leyline of combustion even be playable as anything more than sideboard card at one mana do we really need weird super high variance sideboard cards why put leyline of anticipation into teferi time raveler standard why do have to listen to people tell me how perfect eight card turn two kills are now possible in standard because of leyline of abundance the literal only good thing about leylines in core set is that leyline of the void and leyline of sanctity will go down in price that it love marauding raptor where was this card last year when dinosaur was introduced as creature type in ixalan the excitement level was high dinosaurs are huge part of our culture and the thought of them tromping around on magic battlefields next to elves angels and dragons was just awesome the problem was that they never really got the support they needed to break into competitive play medium sized midrange ground creatures frankly aren that exciting and enablers like drover of the mighty and otepec huntmaster were too fragile to make much of difference the enrage mechanic also flopped because it was only very good against red and green better late than never right marauding raptor is awesome attempting to solve basically all of dinosaur problems at once it cost reducer it sized well it attacks well and most importantly it makes enrage actually matter get your ranging raptors and ripjaw raptors ready because dinosaurs are finally ready to take the stage old and new not gonna lie am super pumped to start brewing up core set standard decks there are lot of new exciting things to do as well as lot of powerful upgrades to decks that just weren quite there yet by propping up cards that previously didn have enough support it almost like the set is much bigger than it is because those dinosaurs vampires goblins and spirits that aren seeing play are now on the table too get ready friends pic twitter com mjqbikvogr mtg arena mtg_arena june ll be jamming out ten new standard brews on my stream this coming monday as part of the special mtg arena core set streamer preview and next friday you can expect me to go over all ten decks with grades and reports on how they did and what to expect from them in the future
so far hogaak arisen necropolis has stolen most of the thunder from modern horizons the hogaak bridgevine deck has taken the format by storm to level that has players calling for bans in manner that may actually be properly founded however it not all doom and gloom there ton of fun cards in modern horizons beyond the hogaak menace ranging from sweet reprints to intriguing throwbacks to all new toys force of negation is one of the most hyped cards in the set and for good reason as it helps give fair decks new and powerful tool to handle the myriad of broken things you may play against in any given match of modern however that not the only modern horizons card interested in time stamps match match match match match dimir ninjas modern jim davis creatures fallen shinobi ninja of the deep hours snapcaster mage faerie seer ingenious infiltrator mausoleum wanderer instants logic knot mana leak tyrant scorn vapor snag spell pierce disrupting shoal fatal push force of negation opt lands marsh flats watery grave darkslick shores polluted delta scalding tarn snow covered swamp snow covered island sideboard ceremonious rejection hostage taker surgical extraction deathmark thoughtseize collective brutality hurkyl recall countersquall buy this deck export text format ninjas return in modern horizons and while ninja of the deep hours has made waves in pauper and in cubes it has never really had successful jump into modern and legacy well maybe that because he never had best friend before ingenious infiltrator is strictly better upgrade to ninja of the deep hours providing crucial extra point of toughness as well as the ability to stack up many draws paired up with another modern horizons surprise faerie seer we start to see unique blue based aggressive deck take shape with the ability to be aggressive and draw loads of cards we turn to an eight pack of pitch counterspells as the new force of negation joins disrupting shoal to allow you to continue to develop your board as you stymie your opponent progress sprinkle in some of the best and cheapest interactive dimir spells and we ve got an aggressive tempo deck that is going to be hell on any spell based deck of course as we saw in the matches we re also going to struggle against creature based decks with so much of our countermagic focused on non creature spells game against hogaak based decks also seems tough but both matchups can be tuned with proper sideboarding if you re looking for an extremely fun deck that is fantastic against spell based decks it hard to go wrong with ninjas
wait what we re in preview season again didn war of the spark just come out oh wait mean modern horizons god just can keep up anymore it certainly doesn help the new set fatigue that both war of the spark and modern horizons were hugely influential sets and we ve barely scratched the surface of their effects on all formats but here we are once again core sets are nice for wizards of the coast because they have much wider berth than with normal expansions they can reprint cards that seem good for standard plug holes and prop up themes that aren as good as they thought they would be and have it still make thematic sense there are no restrictions like there are with sets located on certain planes so they can print that extra dinosaur or vampire with no continuity based issues core set is already looking like powerful and impactful set so today we re going to take our first gander at the card list and talk about some cards that stood out to me at first glance let go where else would start many of my early big finishes were with goblins they won me my first ptq took me to top of grand prix dallas got me number of early scg tour open top and took me all the way to the finals of an early scg tour invitational doubt there are many players who have put goblin ringleader into play more than me and it not short selling it to say it one of my favorite cards of all time was very surprised when it wasn in modern horizons as goblins feels like it would be very fun deck for the format that would be tame by current modern standards well now we see why rather than just being relegated to the world of modern we get to play goblin ringleader in standard as well the question of course is will he have any friends it is very odd they chose to print handful of good goblins in dominaria and core set including old friends goblin warchief and siege gang commander as well as new tribal cards like volley veteran but didn give them the support they would have needed to make an impact now we get goblin ringleader only to see the other good goblin cards rotate out in few months regardless goblin ringleader asks lot but also provides you with the worthwhile payoff you need to commit yourself to playing bunch of tribal creatures you need to play lot of goblins in your deck to make goblin ringleader effective but once you start drawing them by the fistfuls it doesn matter if they are bit underpowered if he has support he will be very playable in standard and now modern goblins has chance to succeed as something more than cheese you out deck excited ah yes just what we always wanted more planeswalkers three chandras in one set more planeswalkers kidding aside the uncommon rare mythic progression of chandra planeswalkers is pretty cool design as is the idea of focusing on single planeswalker story across one set however while chandra awakened inferno is the big splashy mythic rare of the cycle chandra acolyte of flame is by far the best chandra in the set as well as probably the best planeswalker in the set while her first ability is mostly just that doesn do anything that honestly fine coming out of three mana planeswalker five loyalty is great starting point and if you get to add some loyalty counters to other planeswalkers it nice bonus her second ability isn much but the ability to pressure planeswalkers without losing card is paramount in standard right now answering teferi time raveler and narset parter of veils is perhaps one of the biggest concerns in the whole format and chandra does good job at poking them for essentially free however chandra true draw is her ability jace vryn prodigy was extremely underrated at first because it felt like you only got one shot at the snapcaster mage effect and then it didn do anything for while it turns out getting instant value while also having must answer permanent in play for fairly low cost is very good chandra also isn limited to only red spells so you can flash back thought erasure cast down or whatever else strikes your fancy chandra is the real deal take that teferi sideboard color hosers have always had weird history in magic you don want your postboard games to feel like battle of who can draw their sideboard card first so cards like boil choke and chill are just far too much however having access to non maindeckable effects that are very good at keeping certain strategies in check is great way to maintain balance in standard format if teferi and friends are running rampant having something like fry around to keep the balance is nice that all really just nice and clean cycle of sideboard cards is great thing to have access to another blast from the past was one of the first players to find success playing planar cleansing in my control deck over detention sphere an innovation that would go on to win subsequent pro tour control theros standard rd place scg tour open providence creatures aetherling planeswalkers elspeth sun champion jace architect of thought instants deicide last breath syncopate azorius charm dissolve sphinx revelation sorceries planar cleansing divination supreme verdict lands island plains azorius guildgate hallowed fountain mutavault temple of enlightenment sideboard deicide celestial flare archangel of thune renounce the guilds jace memory adept dispel negate reprisal gainsay last breath buy this deck export text format the biggest draw to planar cleansing was its ability to clean up mixed threat board comprised of both creatures and variety of planeswalkers sound familiar war of the spark standard is defined by planeswalkers and creatures with teferi time raveler making counterspells almost unplayable and narset parter of veils making it hard to draw cards without using planeswalkers pretty much everything that is happening in standard is happening on the battlefield this leads to cluttered boards and complicated boardstates that are hard to gain an edge on one of the reasons why command the dreadhorde is so good is that it goes so far over the top on the board or can rebuild board that was taken apart planar cleansing changes all of that with the ability to clean up everything no questions asked with so few decks playing countermagic at the moment planar cleansing may just be the answer the format needs this card feels like an apology wizards of the coast when we debuted dinosaurs as creature type in ixalan we knew everyone was going to be very excited and we were too however we missed the mark on power level and were just as sad as you all were that dinosaur tribal wasn playable as an apology for that transgression we decided to print this very obvious dinosaur enabler in core set to try and make things right for the few months that ixalan is still legal enjoy dinosaurs have struggled to gain much traction in standard because the early plays just aren that good cards like drover of the mighty are mostly just embarrassing and enrage is mechanic that is irrelevant if you re not getting into heavy creature combat or playing against red marauding raptor solves both of these problems marauding raptor is mana creature that isn embarrassing helping to power out cards like ripjaw raptor and regisaur alpha ahead of schedule while not limiting you to just playing dinosaurs it also does so as respectable and reasonably durable which will have value later in the game and often attack for four and that triggered ability sure it drawback for playing things with less than three toughness but huge boon to any card with enrage turn three ripjaw raptor and draw card that sounds awesome marauding raptor may also be the card that gets ranging raptors to see play while it may not have much of future post ixalan rotation marauding raptor is certainly going to be impressive while it gets to play with its dinosaur friends wait was this card supposed to be in modern horizons elvish reclaimer feels great crop rotation is widely played effect in the formats it is legal in and elvish reclaimer is spellshaper for crop rotation that also is well sized creature in its own right being able to get any land is huge game and while elvish reclaimer may not make huge impact in standard it is excellent in older formats with fetchlands in the mix it is very easy to make elvish reclaimer into turning it into sort of wild nacatl knight of the reliquary split card that lot of power for only one mana the hardest part about playing knight of the reliquary is hoping you get to untap with it and untapping with elvish reclaimer is much more doable elvish reclaimer is great jaw hits the floor okay spectral sailor may not be the best card in core set but as someone who has played azure mage fathom feeder and mystic archeologist in number of standard control deck sideboards over the years to success spectral sailor just floors me not only is mana flying flash creature certainly above rate when compared to two mana ground creature having your card draw engine come down that early before any chance of it being countered is huge we don currently live in world where counterspell based control decks are thing thanks to teferi time raveler but if we did spectral sailor would be an amazing tool out of the sideboard beyond my wildest control sideboard dreams we have very solid drop for aggressive or tribal decks as well spectral sailor wears curious obsession just as well as pteramander or mistcloak herald ever did while also playing perfectly in the mid to late game with counterspells by forcing your opponent into action spectral sailor also has two relevant creature types going for it as well spirits is deck in modern but don forget that supreme phantom is still legal in standard ixalan pirates still exist as well always falling short of playability by just not having enough good cards don forget that lookout dispersal is actually very good magic card and siren stormtamer is pirate too in love with spectral sailor new stuff fatigue while it tough trying to parse new cards when we ve barely figured out the ones that just came out few weeks ago it is still also pretty exciting to have so much to think about so far core set looks like very interesting mix of old and new with the possibility of effecting multiple formats at once while also propping up strategies in standard that have fallen just short love the idea of unloved standard cards finally getting some time in the spotlight so that hit for me and goblin ringleader is back
one of the complaints with standard formats late in their cycle is that things can get stale while frankly this standard format has been one of the most dynamic in long time and we are far from solving it the metagame begins to coalesce into handful of top decks and strategies and it feels like there isn room to innovate screw that arcades brother nicol bolas has been getting the entire spotlight while mostly failing at making mark as grixis decks continue to flounder but there are in fact other elder dragon legends arcades has the look of super casual card but his excellent stats combined with super high payoff for playing lot of defenders makes him worth second look he also has some help from the azorius senate as high alert helps to fill out the strategy with some much needed redundancy throw in some of the best cards in standard in llanowar elves and teferi time raveler and we start to see the beginnings of very fun but competitive deck time stamps match match match match match match arcades alert war standard jim davis creatures portcullis vine saruli caretaker arboreal grazer arcades the strategist llanowar elves wall of runes planeswalkers teferi hero of dominaria teyo the shieldmage teferi time raveler enchantments conclave tribunal high alert lands forest glacial fortress hallowed fountain breeding pool hinterland harbor sunpetal grove temple garden sideboard the wanderer baffling end slaughter the strong dovin veto disdainful stroke trostani discordant knight of autumn buy this deck export text format export arena format one of the most important things when brewing fun deck for standard is making sure you still play powerful cards and we ve done good job of that while sticking to the theme unfortunately our opponents had other plans for us this was certainly rough set of matches playing against two decks that we don matchup well against over and over again we want our walls to be doing double duty both blocking and activating our synergies and neither esper control nor bant ramp does lot of attacking in the early game still don like to cherry pick my videos or content as there as much or more to be learned from bad matchups than from good ones regardless of the outcome of this set of matches ve played the deck to success on stream and it really is surprisingly powerful and fun deck if you re looking for an off the radar brew with lot of fun and power built in arcades is waiting for you
teferi time raveler and narset parter of veils are completely messed up magic cards while the duo has been making waves in standard the real damage they ve been doing is in the older formats where their static abilities stack up much more favorably and they are much harder to remove when you think about it it not weird at all that planeswalker that removes your opponent ability to interact while also dealing with wide variety of permanents or full on dig through time that turns off many of your opponent best cards would be good while both planeswalkers are good in fair or control shells where they really shine is in combo decks teferi means you can combo without your opponent getting chance to interact while also having an answer to whatever piece of hate they might have and narset digs super deep to help you find the pieces that you need while also limiting your opponent options with both these new pieces in place happy to announce that splinter twin is back in modern okay well not exactly but not going to lie it pretty damn close jeskai saheeli modern jim davis th place scgcon modern champs creatures snapcaster mage felidar guardian planeswalkers narset parter of veils saheeli rai teferi time raveler instants lightning helix spell pierce remand lightning bolt path to exile sorceries serum visions enchantments spreading seas lands mountain plains island celestial colonnade glacial fortress sacred foundry sulfur falls arid mesa hallowed fountain steam vents flooded strand scalding tarn sideboard narset parter of veils crumble to dust rest in peace supreme verdict stony silence geist of saint traft dispel celestial purge vendilion clique engineered explosives wrath of god buy this deck export text format for the unfamiliar the combo is fairly simple saheeli rai can make copy of felidar guardian which enters the battlefield and can flicker saheeli rai thereby resetting her she can then be activated again to make copy of felidar guardian which will then flicker saheeli again all the copies have haste so you can rinse and repeat several million times and then attack your opponent with several million cats the saheeli rai felidar guardian combo has been floating around in modern since it was banned in standard but never really was much more than fringe deck because the supporting cast was so lackluster felidar guardian is much less nimble card than deceiver exarch while also requiring decent cards to blink for value so it can do more than just be combo piece wall of omens sucks but it was necessity because there wasn anything better good lord believe me when tell you that teferi and narset are worlds better than anything the deck has ever had teferi is already good card but it plays so well in the deck and with the combo that it frightening you can use it early to buy tempo bounce annoying things like aether vial pyromancer ascension of amulet of vigor to buy time and then blink it and do it all over again with felidar guardian once teferi is in play the race is on for your opponent to kill it before you can combo otherwise they can react this creates yet another sub game for your opponent to have to deal with making their life even more difficult as they try to progress their own game plan while also trying to ensure they can interact with you in lot of ways narset is the card that is directly replacing wall of omens providing you with source of card advantage that plays very nice with felidar guardian if you thought one dig through time was good you re gonna love doing it all over again as the curve of narset into feldiar guardian is just cascade of card advantage and selection the fact that narset is one of the best cards in the format against izzet phoenix as well as many of the other best cards in the format is almost gravy and if you don love gravy there something wrong with you the deck is rounded out with full roster of jeskai control staples ranging from great removal in lightning bolt and path to exile smattering of countermagic to bridge the gap and defend your combo in remand and spell pierce and snapcaster mage and serum visions to bring it all together all of these cards are proven pieces of interaction in the modern metagame doing great job of keeping you alive while you set up your card advantage engines and eventual combo spell pierce deserves special mention because of how well it slots into the deck this is not pure control deck so we are very interested in making tempo positive plays and that exactly what spell pierce helps to set up being able to play planeswalker on four mana and defend either it or yourself is great as well as defending your combo pieces on your combo turn spell pierce is also amazing against all sorts of nonsense that can be tough to beat from cathartic reunion to chalice of the void to karn liberated which is great thing to have in such wild and wide open format as modern no seriously it splinter twin if you ve ever played the old splinter twin decks before it was banned you ll be right in your element playing jeskai saheeli the deck plays out in remarkably similar fashion as you have great interactive core to react to your opponent plays as well as the fear of god from your opponent that you will just combo kill them it lacks the end of turn deceiver exarch untapped kill you surprise potential but can still kill out of nowhere with six mana and no board just use felidar guardian to flicker and untap land and then cast saheeli and both combo pieces are fairly durable if they are in play making the combo not difficult to set up felidar guardian isn as nimble as deceiver exarch but is much more powerful overall and can help accrue huge advantage all by itself by blinking planeswalkers spreading seas or even snapcaster mage saheeli rai is certainly the splinter twin half of the combo in that she is less universally useful but scrying is nice and you ll find yourself copying snapcaster mage often enough to be happy just like splinter twin you re not really in any huge rush to combo but sometimes you will just run shaleei on three and felidar guardian on four and run some people over who aren interested in interacting control decks often suffer in modern because they lack that kind of closing power but jeskai saheeli has no problem slamming the door when it needs to it hard to understate how important having that kind of power in your modern deck is as the format is very hostile to decks that durdle too much putting it in practice both ben friedman and played slightly different versions of jeskai saheeli at scgcon but in discussing our lists together both before and after the tournament we are convinced the deck is excellent the invitational didn go as planned mostly due to average performances in standard but both ben and made top of the sunday modern summer championship with the deck lost very close match to an azorius spirits deck in top while ben went on to split in the top four of course with modern horizons about to shake modern up even more we are in major state of flux right now but jeskai saheeli is great place to start the deck is powerful interactive and both very fun and challenging to play and play against it is also very adaptable with wide range of great maindeck and sideboard options if you ve been waiting for splinter twin to be unbanned this is about as close as you re going to get
today we re going to do something little different normally bringing you either decks that ve brewed and worked on stream or at an event or decks that have been floating around the top tables of either tournament or online play however today we re going to take look at what the beginnings of brew looks like every great deck starts as nothing more than an idea and by starting from that point you will get to see the process that goes into figuring out what works and doesn work today idea is what if we used discard spells in our saheeli rai felidar guardian combo deck to both protect our combo as well as disrupt our opponent most saheeli rai combo decks are either straight jeskai or touch on green for mana creatures and creature tutoring but what if we went in the other direction and added discard instead discard spells could help act as preemptive answer to things that would disrupt their combo let us know when the coast is clear and buy us time to set up discard spells also play great with teferi time raveler as even when our opponent is empty handed we can use them on their draw step the cost of course is that we need to play four colors which can be difficult time stamps match match match match match four color saheeli combo modern jim davis creatures wall of omens felidar guardian planeswalkers narset parter of veils saheeli rai teferi time raveler instants path to exile fatal push sorceries inquisition of kozilek thoughtseize serum visions enchantments spreading seas lands blood crypt godless shrine hallowed fountain steam vents marsh flats watery grave interplanar beacon flooded strand polluted delta snow covered island snow covered plains snow covered swamp sideboard kaya orzhov usurper rest in peace stony silence geist of saint traft engineered explosives dispel collective brutality supreme verdict wrath of god buy this deck export text format while the idea itself sorta worked discard spells into planeswalkers was fairly effective the costs associated with playing four colors were fairly high we were routinely starting games at about or life as we would need to fetch and shock few times while also taking damage from thoughtseize this made life difficult against more aggressive decks and made setting up more difficult interplanar beacon was cute but may have caused more problems than it solved lacking lightning bolt and snapcaster mage also made dealing with enemy planeswalkers more difficult and we were very one dimensional in our game plan however the most important thing from any time you take an idea into war is to learn everything you can from it most ideas die brutal deaths on the battlefield but every battle has chance to be victory when you learn from it the things you learn from each attempt help inform your view on the format and future attempts what we did learn is that both teferi time raveler and narset parter of veils were insanely powerful in the deck they inject new life into an archetype that had toiled on the fringes of the format for while giving it tools it never had tune in on friday to see what this idea eventually led to
scgcon is here one of the most exciting events on the magic calendar the invitational at scgcon not only caps off the first season of the scg tour but also puts both standard and modern under the spotlight and scrutiny of total prize purse stakes are high putting enormous amount of pressure on players to be right on top of the trends in both formats further complicating things is that war of the spark has completely upended both formats creating one of the most dynamic week to week standard formats in recent memory while also producing waves rarely seen by standard legal set in modern there lot of information to take in and lot of factors at play making putting it all together very challenging these trends make the rules for each format week in and week out and whether you want to follow the trends or buck them you have to know what they are here what currently happening in both formats standard you need to have great early game or great late game while planeswalkers define the midgame of the current standard format the reality is that almost all successful standard decks either seek to have great early game or some sort of way over the top endgame while the four color dreadhorde deck ve been playing lot recently certainly is the strategy taken to its fullest extent other decks have been getting in on the fun as well more fair version of sultai dreadhorde has been making the rounds as well recently played by friends of mine dan jessup to mcq finals finish and jarvis yu to top finish at grand prix kansas city sultai dreadhorde war standard jarvis yu th place

singleton in other midrange decks that can cast it like esper midrange further cementing it as one of the most powerful endgames in the format however even going over the top of that is the surge of

export text format export arena format while enormously expensive when fueled by many ramp creatures and nissa who shakes the world large mass manipulation can be cast as early as turn four hydroid krasis gives the deck the engine to refuel giving the deck very robust endgame the deck is very reliant on its mana creatures but the payoffs are huge standard endgames are way over the top at the moment and you must either have something to match them answer them or get under them mono red aggro is of course the poster child for getting under these big effects looking to end the game long before anyone should be thinking about casting mass manipulation while also having many effective answers to mana creatures amusingly enough with experimental frenzy mono red also threatens to have its own powerful endgame helping to explain why it one of the best and most consistent decks in the format white weenie had fallen by the wayside but took the mcq played last weekend by storm and plots out as my pick for breakout deck at scgcon it checks all the boxes as far as going fast while being very underprepared for if all the big go over the top decks are going to skimp on removal white is poised to run them right over and out of town tocatli honor guard is also huge problem for any command the dreadhorde deck relying on the explore package it tough tightrope to balance with decks having such great late games and early games with ton of play in between but it huge part of why this format has been so dynamic standard nissa is the current queen of standard the more the standard format adapts the more stock that nissa who shakes the world gains it no surprise that both the sultai dreadhorde deck and the bant ramp deck are centered around nissa who shakes the world who is quickly becoming one of the best cards in the format when it comes to going over the top nissa and her static ability is one of the best cards you can have and her ability to pressure planeswalkers and defend makes her incredibly well rounded oh and with llanowar elves leading the charge you cast her on turn three the format has done good job adapting to teferi time raveler but now needs to also adapt to beat nissa the tools are certainly there though tomik distinguished advokist isn just for legacy tomik is already well costed creature with evasion but she also shuts down nissa ability to effect the board which goes long way toward taking nissa out of the picture any aggressive deck playing tomik should be able to make the turn player plays nissa without adding blocker to the board very punishing sweepers are some amount of good against nissa neither card is seeing any maindeck play at the moment but both are astoundingly punishing against decks built around nissa and mana creatures the downside of course is that they don effect planeswalkers but they re also both good against mono red aggro white weenie and gruul which is large portion of the format if someone can find good kaya wrath deck for this weekend they are poised to do very well modern war of the spark planeswalkers are changing everything there no doubt that planeswalkers are the name of the game in standard but the real surprise is how much of an impact they are having on modern as well karn the great creator impact on modern has been fairly well documented at this point giving tron powerful and versatile new tool as well as boosting up eldrazi tron and various other prison and big mana strategies it would be remiss of me to not mention him mycosynth lattice and friends but that not the real surprise these two again that right teferi and narset are not just for standard both cards are currently changing the landscape of modern throwing huge wrenches into the plans of many of the established decks teferi drastically hurts the plans of any reactive deck in the format while indirectly messing with whole bunch of cards and abilities finale of promise chandra torch of defiance bloodbraid elf rift bolt search for tomorrow and so on narset is just as brutal attaching static ability that turns off everything from serum visions to faithless looting to chromatic star on top of dig through time spread over two turns that lot of value for three mana both teferi and narset have the ability to completely change how we think of control and combo decks in modern while also spawning the possibility of new archetypes teferi in particular is very good at defending combos from interaction and hate cards and expect both to be major players both at scgcon and going forward put these cards in your modern decks and make sure you can beat them modern be ready for fair fight with teferi and narset pushing toward interaction and humans izzet phoenix and control all making bids for the top deck in modern the pendulum has certainly swung pretty hard towards the fair side of things just being fast or super linear is risky thing at the moment as if you lack the tools to interact and play longer game you may find yourself in trouble having feel for how fair or unfair format is goes long way toward both selecting your deck for an event or for tuning your chosen deck and sideboard for what you expect make sure your deck can deal with these new interactive elements and don be shy about including plan of some kind eyes on the prize scgcon is always an exciting event but even more so as we get to see what the conclusions drawn by the best and brightest minds on the scg tour are in high stakes environment of course will be playing in the event but whether you re there or not you should be paying close attention to the event and coverage and make sure to watch both formats split format events are notorious for spreading false information as player who make have broken the format in one format may do poorly in the other and fall short of top keep an eye on the decks that are doing well in their respective formats and at the new ideas being presented not every idea will work at first but it may be pathway to something great later on hopefully the one you watch hoist the trophy
while it is often very active format with flavor of the week decks shifting in and out and rotating cast of main characters true new change doesn happen to modern that often modern horizons looks to upset that paradigm but typical sets don tend to change things too much so it comes as surprise that the biggest effect war of the spark set focused around an army of new and powerful planeswalkers would have is adding very big pig to somewhat forgotten archetype breathing new life into proven glass cannon goryo vengeance decks have long been considered too fragile for modern offering high power that is too inconsistent and disruptable especially in format where people aren afraid to maindeck surgical extraction however ilharg the raze boar alongside oft forgotten common generator servant gives the deck more of plan that doesn rely on the graveyard at all this is huge boon for the deck as no longer is the plan against graveyard hate through the breach and prayer time stamps match match match match match boaryo vengance modern dominick harvey th place scg louisville creatures generator servant simian spirit guide emrakul the aeons torn griselbrand ilharg the raze boar instants goryo vengeance through the breach sorceries cathartic reunion collective brutality faithless looting artifacts pentad prism lands mountain swamp scalding tarn blood crypt polluted delta blackcleave cliffs bloodstained mire gemstone caverns sideboard abrade anger of the gods terastodon thoughtseize lightning axe chalice of the void blood moon buy this deck export text format dominik harvey new take on goryo vengeance rewarded him with top finish at scg louisville war of the spark debut in modern and raises renewed interest in the archetype while emrakul the aeons torn won trigger annihilator off the raze boar trigger it is clean damage that can happen on turn two giving the deck full on early kill that it was lacking there were also number of times that we just cast our and we re able to play reasonable game of magic as well the deck is still somewhat vulnerable to disruption and finicky at times but we are looking at an exciting evolution of forgotten archetype if you re fan of sneak and show in legacy or just fan of degenerate griselbrand shenanigans in general the big pig is certainly worth look
the best combo decks aren actually combo decks they re reasonable perhaps slightly underpowered fair decks that are fully capable of winning normal game of magic but also have the ability to execute powerful combo when needed either to provide for fast and unexpected wins or to bring themselves back from the brink when they are behind in many ways the mere threat of their combo finish is more dangerous than the combo itself forcing their opponents to play scared and make bad trades it can also lead opponents to oversideboard for the combo element ripe to fall prey to the fair plan four

around good value creatures the format best midrange engine and combo finish that revolved around bringing stuff back from the graveyard sound familiar despite differences in composition and how it actually wins the four color dreadhorde deck that has been making waves in standard lately is eerily similar to the four color rally decks of old it plays some of the best fair cards in the format while simultaneously looking to execute big combo finish that will end the game it attacks from many angles and the flexibility it has it what makes it so difficult to play against four color

harbor temple garden interplanar beacon overgrown tomb woodland cemetery sideboard swamp cast down duress kraul harpooner massacre girl narset parter of veils the elderspell thrashing brontodon unmoored ego buy this deck export text format export arena format let break the deck down into its component parts the creatures just like four color rally used the tried and proven midrange core of its time collected company reflector mage and jace vyrn prodigy we are using the tried and proven core that has formed the backbone of many of this standard midrange deck in the explore package it no secret that wildgrowth walker jadelight ranger and merfolk branchwalker are quite the trio not only do the explore creatures help you to make your land drops dump few extra cards into the graveyard and allow you to both attack and defend early but they fall right into the deck main plan of simply trading resources in the early and mid game against aggressive decks they help keep you alive and against slower decks they can come down quickly and allow you to start pressuring and getting ahead so you can get your planeswalkers and eventual command the dreadhorde engine going while your opponent is off balance getting ahead is important because of part two the planeswalkers while your explore creatures won often get the job done all by themselves what they excel at is setting the stage for phase two your planeswalkers planeswalkers are card type that is at its absolute best when you are ahead which ideally is exactly where you will be after an early game full of explore creatures each planeswalker has the ability to effect the board the turn it comes into play hopefully allowing you to continue to press your advantage teferi time raveler is one of the best cards in standard and worth the hassle of the white splash not only is teferi an amazing tempo card that helps you to both not die and get ahead teferi also provides you with incidental insurance against counterspells having command the dreadhorde countered sucks and teferi makes sure that doesn happen at an extremely low opportunity cost teferi is also awesome bring back with command the dreadhorde to effect the board right away vraska golgari queen and sorin vengeful bloodlord are both solid midrange planeswalkers that do lot of grindy work necessary to keep up in the midgame lot of times vraska will come down kill something and then get attacked but lightning helix that can come back from the graveyard is totally fine in this deck she also handles small planeswalkers well too sorin plays amazingly well with the explore package giving you extra copies of wildgrowth walker or your explorers while also gaining you lot of life for big command the dreadhorde for when it time to go off speaking of going off the combo now this is not combo deck in the sense that it kills your opponent immediately when it goes off but most of the time any sufficiently large command the dreadhorde will create an impenetrable board position that is not only almost impossible to lose from but can be recreated at moment notice the true core of the combo lies in your explore package as wildgrowth walker is the card that not only gives you the life to play with when you first cast command the dreadhorde but also all the life you spent on it back and more as you return wildgrowth walker and explore creatures along with whatever else you are getting tamiyo collector of tales also ends up in this section because of how well she plays with command the dreadhorde unlike the other planeswalkers she doesn affect the board when she comes into play but she does help both fill your graveyard up and find command the dreadhorde or let you recur it and cast it again letting you play small value commands in the midgame for only small amount the extras the deck also has few flex spots which can be shaped by what the metagame is currently looking like massacre girl has bounced around from the sideboard to the maindeck as it only super effective against creature heavy decks like white weenie or decks that are heavily invested in mana creatures and nissa who shakes the world in most other matchups you are heavily invested in building board and massacre girl can make that hard to do however with nissa who shakes the world very popular right now massacre girl is back in the maindeck just having access to single copy in game is very valuable as the deck can usually find it trostani discordant is very effective flex card at the moment as not only is she good stopgap against mono red aggro but she also helps to handle thief of sanity hostage taker entrancing melody mass manipulation and most importantly the mirror you must be aware that she can form non bo with your own command the dreadhorde if you steal your opponent creatures they will get them back but by that same token she is very good surprise in the mirror you know you have her so make sure you play accordingly playing the deck make those trades trading resources is the name of the game with this deck as it is your goal to keep your opponent busy with all of your early creatures and planeswalkers while you set up for your inevitable endgame your explore creatures are wonderful for this providing mild pressure and great defense so do whatever you can to get them into combat early and often the same goes for your planeswalkers ideally you will be playing them when you are ahead and getting them to stick but lot of the time teferi being repulse life or vraska being abrupt decay life is exactly what you are looking for every time you block creature or make their creature attack your planeswalker instead of you is valuable time and life you re gaining as you work toward your command the dreadhorde endgame what is the endgame going to look like it very important to have clear idea of where you are going you re going to be playing longer games primarily and things will often start to get bit bogged down in the midgame as the board gets larger and larger make sure you have clear idea of what the end of the game is going to look like are you going to need to cast huge command the dreadhorde to win will grinding it out with your creatures and planeswalkers be enough what sort of top end threats or interaction is your opponent bringing to the table answering these questions will help you sculpt your gameplan the sideboard guide quick notes about sideboarding paradise druid comes out lot because post board games tend to slow down and she is vulnerable to things like goblin chainwhirler and mass removal command the dreadhorde gets shaved against aggressive decks but if you do cut all or most of them you need to recognize you no longer have ultimate inevitably and play accordingly tamiyo often gets shaved after board as it can be bit unwieldy and cards are more likely to hit the graveyard naturally once each player has the proper interaction the five mana spells often get shaved in and out depending on the matchup teferi hero of dominaria is one of the worst cards in the deck and only really there to deal with opposing planeswalkers mono red aggro in duress

what your opponent is playing the cards they are sideboarding and how they are approaching the matchup the dreadhorde boss four color dreadhorde is one of the best decks in standard right now and it is also one of the most challenging decks ve played in long time you not only need to manage somewhat wild mana base and quirky endgame but play out many turns with wide swath of options available to you you may just find yourself in situation like this yikes the basic rules of tempo and building your board are important but most vital of all is having an understanding of how the game is going to fully play out and being able to move yourself toward your goal your plays must have unified purpose and that purpose is moving target that varies from matchup to matchup four color deck that is challenging but rewarding to play very powerful and uses card previously thought to bulk rare to amazing effect sign me up
oh boy this format is moving fast as talked about last friday it feels like this format has been evolving almost on daily basis new decks new rules of engagement and even newer decks trying to break those rules at scg syracuse greedy mana bases were the order of the day with both the lotus box jeskai planeswalkers deck and the four color dreadhorde deck played running zero basic lands both decks were the breakout decks of the event and have been heavily played since as such people have been trying to ruin their fun quite literally with assassin trophy and field of ruin many of the japanese mpl players brought land destruction themed goglari midrange deck to the mpl weekly event last weekend with the intent of punishing greedy mana bases to the max it features many normal elements of golgari midrange but with full package of assassin trophy and field of ruin complemented by war of the spark haymaker casualties of war against any opponent with zero or one basic lands and heavy mana requirements this deck is poised to make it very hard for them to play magic and the fallback plan of playing solid golgari midrange build works as well time stamps match match match match match golgari land death war standard jim davis creatures carnage tyrant ravenous chupacabra paradise druid jadelight ranger llanowar elves merfolk branchwalker wildgrowth walker planeswalkers vraska golgari queen nissa who shakes the world vivien reid instants assassin trophy sorceries casualties of war lands swamp forest field of ruin overgrown tomb woodland cemetery sideboard duress the elderspell ob nixilis cruelty moment of craving cast down thrashing brontodon crucible of worlds massacre girl buy this deck export text format export arena format of course the problem with playing metagame deck is that sometimes you don run into the metagame you expect we played against three mono colored aggro decks which exposed us for the middle of the road golgari deck that we were as well as two three color decks that had couple of basic lands along with their duals and there the rub really if your opponent is playing lot of basic lands this deck is going to struggle to do what it wants to do if your opponent isn playing basic lands you re likely to crush but either way when you play metagame deck you are subjecting yourself to the will of the pairing gods to an extent players are adapting as well as by this point any smart jeskai or four color dreadhorde player is playing at least one basic land to prevent getting cheesed out make no mistake this deck is tool if your metagame is infested with greedy mana bases pick up the hammer and punish them but if you re looking at well adapted mana bases and mono colored aggro decks you re going to reach into the toolbox for something else
the speed at which this new war of the spark standard format is moving is astounding in few short weeks we ve gone from simic nexus is the end of the world to esper control is unstoppable to mono red still great to arclight phoenix is back to mox amber wins tournament the crazy thing is it feels like we ve barely scratched the surface the influx of powerful planeswalkers and their various and sometimes frustrating static abilities has caused an upheaval of everything we thought we knew drastically changing the landscape of what cards are effective in the format previous format staples like absorb and chemister insight look downright silly with so many copies of teferi time raveler and narset parter of veils floating around and new cards have moved in to take their places in this ever changing ecosystem the value of any card is directly tied to how it interacts in the context of format and today we are going to look at cards that had fallen by the wayside and are now returning because of how well they line up in the new format specifically against planeswalkers like teferi and narset thorn lieutenant you only have to look at the top of scg syracuse last weekend to get real clear picture of where we are currently at in standard the top was five teferi time raveler decks and three mono red aggro decks there were certainly other decks at the event but make no mistake that teferi and goblin chainwhirler are the current litmus test for the format each of them presents test for every threat you may want to play how bad is it if this card is bounced by teferi how vulnerable is this card to goblin chainwhirler cards that don pass these tests must be heavily scrutinized do you know what card is very good against both teferi and mono red thorn lieutenant passes the teferi check even on the draw as if your opponent wants to deploy teferi and bounce your drop to push way ahead on tempo you get elf token that can swing right back and kill teferi many planeswalkers end up going down to one loyalty to kill things so the elf is just the right size to punish them for it thorn lieutenant also is phenomenal against mono red aggro providing drop that always provides value when killed and matches up perfectly against all but their best creatures lastly thorn lieutenant also plays excellently with nissa who shakes the world providing mana sink that is also very relevant on turn two if you re playing green and looking for good drop thorn lieutenant is it legion warboss legion warboss is not nearly as good against mono red aggro as it is against planeswalkers and other slow decks but it is really good against planeswalkers and non interactive decks legion warboss passes the teferi test with flying colors either providing an immediate advantage that can finish off the teferi if it is bounced or as follow up to creature that was bounced by teferi so you can finish it off haste is an exceptional ability against planeswalkers as what makes planeswalkers powerful is the ability to get them going on stable board haste allows you to destabilize the board when your opponent isn expecting it getting to pick off teferi hero of dominaria or ugin the ineffable that minused while also adding significant threat to the board is awesome what legion warboss also excels at is beating up on decks that are just trying to ignore what you are doing there are number of big green nissa who shakes the world decks floating around looking to go over the top of everything as well as the simic deck from last season based around mana acceleration into mass manipulation these decks do not interact well with creatures allowing legion warboss to go wide and wild legion warboss has also replaced thief of sanity as the go to sideboard juke creature from control and planeswalker decks as thief of sanity play so poorly against teferi time raveler that it has started to fall considerably out of favor if you play thief of sanity on turn three and your opponent responds with teferi to minus and send it back to your hand you ve just entered tempo black hole even if you re not looking to play legion warboss yourself make sure you re prepared for it assassin trophy notice anything about the lotus box jeskai planeswalkers deck that won scg syracuse or the four color command the dreadhorde deck played in that event as well zero basic lands ve long been an assassin trophy naysayer giving your opponent free land in standard where there are tons of five and drops as well as cards like hydroid krasis is very hard to stomach assassin trophy allure comes from how cheap and efficient it is but giving your opponent rampant growth on the early turns when you could just play basically any other removal spell is not usually where you want to be until that rampant growth goes away and you re just casting two mana instant speed vindicate of course if the biggest decks in the format continue to be jeskai planeswalkers four color command the dreadhorde and mono red aggro assassin trophy is awesome being able to kill anything with little to no drawback is great and you never have to worry about your removal spell being dead like card like cast down or the elderspell could be and it gets even better because once you know what you re up against you can punish those greedy three color mana bases with well timed sinkhole and even if your opponent has good amount basic lands well you can just time it appropriately and be happy you have an answer to whatever they are bringing to the table field of ruin if you thought sinkhole was great how about one that doesn even take up spell slot in your deck field of ruin is an excellent magic card but its use in standard has mostly been limited to keeping fancy lands like search for azcanta in check however the greedier people get with their mana bases the closer it comes to being super strip mine remember when you activate field of ruin you don actually lose anything because it replaces itself unlike strip mine or wasteland there are also corner case benefits like mana fixing and multiple landfall activations for something like evolution sage but make no mistake here we are looking to stone rain some people out of existence how far you want to take field of ruin is up to you whether you re using it as disruptive element to supplement some beatdowns adding it in with things like assassin trophy to really stack up on the effect or going full lockdown with something like crucible of worlds the end result however is that if people are going to continue to be super greedy with their mana bases there are definitely tools available to punish them nissa who shakes the world as we continue to explore all of the planeswalkers in war of the spark we can take deeper look at some of the more confusing ones it not too hard to figure out what to do with teferi or narset because their power levels are so high but card like nissa who shakes the world can be confusing is nissa ramp card is nissa an aggro midrange card why not both nissa granting your lands both haste and vigilance is superb in format defined by attacking and defending planeswalkers nissa is able to come down and threaten your opponent planeswalkers right away present her own planeswalker presence on the board and also threaten huge follow up turn as you get to untap with all your mana that lot of value for five mana especially in color capable of casting her as early as turn four nissa is seeing some play in big mana mono green decks as well as simic mass manipulation decks and sultai midrange decks but she still isn being played enough if you re playing green you should be taking good long look at nissa who shakes the world moving target these are some of the cards that can give you huge leg up in the current standard format they are direct reaction to current metagame trends and you will likely be seeing lot of them going forward play them or be ready to play against them don forget that the standard metagame is always moving target with this format being even more so than usual take time to notice the trends and why these cards are currently valued so high so that when things shift again you can make similar deductions and pick out the next wave of cards who value has risen due to shifts in the format watching and understanding these trends is what makes good standard player and deck builder
ve said my peace words of it fact all about potential reprints for modern horizons however it now time to get past the theoretical and get into what we will really be working with in modern going forward don forget that modern horizons also has new cards in it and wizards of the coast wants these cards to see play well hold on to your hats because today preview card opens quite the can of worms pitch spells are back there lot to say about what force of vigor means for modern horizons as whole but let not get ahead of ourselves it pretty clear that force of vigor is not maindeck card free spells are inherently dangerous thing so it makes sense to make them reactionary rather than proactive pitch spells serve to be an answer to threat that is coming on too fast to handle by paying mana or an answer you can play while still using your mana to further your own game plan the downside is that while you save on mana you lose out on card force of will is inherently card disadvantage they cast goblin charbelcher you use force of will and another card to stop it they spent one card and some mana you spent two cards of course the good news is that you are still alive and realistically your opponent probably spent bunch of their resources to even cast the charblecher with so many powerful things available in legacy this is why force of will is such an important catch all but it sure does feel bad to have to force of will delver of secrets or tarmogoyf because in those fair matchups the card disadvantage really matters force of vigor changes the math considerably as you can kill two things with it instead of one trading two for two is much more palatable than two for one making force of vigor brutally efficient way to deal with multiple artifacts and enchantments but of course we re only really interested in force of vigor if we have that need there likely two ways force of vigor will be used the first being as splashy artifact enchantment hate card in the vein of shattestorm or ancient grudge while you lose the ability to destroy everything you gain the blowout potential of operating at instant speed while tapped out the second is for decks that don care about the extra card at all and are just looking for cheap way to remove troublesome permanents so they can do their thing neoform combo is perfect candidate for this as they just need to get that grafdigger cage out of the way as cheaply and quickly as possible card advantage be damned the deck building requirements for force of vigor are steep as you need to want one of these two effects while also playing good critical mass of green cards but if the requirements are met the payoff is high not ton of decks are going to want force of vigor but for the ones that do its impact will be substantial it important to note that force of vigor reach goes far beyond modern force of vigor is even better in legacy where troublesome cards like chalice of the void and blood moon are much more common because of the power level of ancient tomb and city of traitors hateful artifacts are much more common and not only that but they are much more effective because of the high density of one mana spells and non basic lands that are commonly played just imagine the look on your evil mono red prison opponent face when you destroy his perfect draw of turn one chalice of the void turn two blood moon with only two cards and no mana being able to destroy batterskull and aether vial at instant speed while tapped out sounds pretty nice too as well as multitude of other more niche applications once again though finding deck with enough of critical mass of green cards that wants the effect isn going to be that common but when force of vigor is cast the impact is going to be game breaking there more to force of vigor however than just the card itself as it opens up the pandora box on new cycle of pitch spells despite the name reference it is still very doubtful that force of will proper is in the set but wouldn be surprised if there is some sort of variant as the blue entry into the cycle note the if it not your turn clause on force of vigor something like this on force of will variant so you can use it to protect your own spells makes whole lot of sense here my prediction force of wherewithal instant if it not your turn you may exile blue card from your hand rather than pay force of wherewithal mana cost counter target non creature spell it turns out this was pretty close to the truth as force of negation is the same thing but at the long standing complaint about modern is that here just aren enough answers for all the powerful things that people get to do as such the best thing to do is just pick something powerful and try and race whatever your opponent is doing wizards of the coast has never had an opportunity to answer this complaint directly until now with modern horizons seeing cycle of pitch spells does not surprise me nor would be surprised if the entire slant of the set was toward more fair and interactive strategies the only question is how far does wizards of the coast want to tip the scales modern has been one of magic most popular formats for long time making it risky prospect to throw it into upheaval and turn it into legacy lite or something else that doesn resemble where it currently at well that all for today pardon me while go ponder what the other three pitch spells are going to do what do you think
so many planeswalkers war of the spark standard is rolling right along and the relative failure of nexus of fate so far has opened the door for all sorts of new midrange superfriend style planeswalker decks there no doubting the power level of many of the new planeswalkers and with many of them playing very well together and offering compounding static abilities that hamper your opponent plans there never been better time to create your own team of superheroes so let get started with four possible squads of superfriends jeskai superfriends war standard jim davis creatures fblthp the lost planeswalkers ugin the ineffable dovin hand of control kasmina enigmatic mentor teferi hero of dominaria narset parter of veils sarkhan the masterless teferi time raveler instants shock spell pierce sorceries deafening clarion enchantments search for azcanta artifacts mox amber lands island clifftop retreat sulfur falls glacial fortress hallowed fountain interplanar beacon sacred foundry steam vents sideboard spell pierce search for azcanta lava coil deafening clarion dovin veto prison realm lyra dawnbringer the wanderer buy this deck export text format export arena format this deck has been bouncing around different player streams for the last week with believe the genesis of the deck coming from mpl member john rolf there no doubt that the first few weeks of war of the spark standard have been all about teferi time raveler and narset parter of veils each of these three mana planeswalkers has card advantage built right in but even more important is their passive abilities that restrict your opponent actions drastically both of these walkers are large reason why nexus of fate decks have floundered so far teferi time raveler is great at clearing the board and getting you deeper into your deck while also making sure that counterspells don work against you and there are no awkward surprises in combat or at the end of your turn we don play many sorceries ourselves to give flash but the one we do in deafening clarion is amazing on our opponent turn narset parter of veils is essentially sorcery speed dig through time card that currently banned in modern and legacy getting to dig four cards deep is amazing at finding you what you need and even better her passive shuts down many of your opponent card advantage engines and of course don forget the powerhouse that is teferi hero of dominaria topping off this party is the awesome sarkhan the masterless while sarkhan is great card on his own when put him at the helm of host of other planeswalkers he ascends to something even greater it hard to imagine sarkhan wanting to hang out with the likes of clashing personalities like dovin or narset but once they take to the skies as dragons the game ends very quickly sarkhan produces threats threatens planeswalkers and most importantly closes the game out in hurry the support cast gets the job done as both dovin hand of control and kasmina enigmatic mentor are surprisingly effective despite being uncommons shock and spell pierce are both in awesome spots in the metagame and they pair up very well with mox amber and fblthp the lost to bridge you to the early game spell pierce in particular can either counter opposing planeswalkers or help defend yours and you haven lived until you ve cast turn two or three spell pierce off mox amber deafening clarion keeps the board clear and search for azcanta keeps the gas flowing against slower decks of all of the superfriends decks we re looking at today jeskai is the safest golgari superfriends war standard jim davis creatures evolution sage jadelight ranger llanowar elves merfolk branchwalker wildgrowth walker planeswalkers davriel rogue shadowmage karn scion of urza ugin the ineffable vivien reid liliana dreadhorde general vraska golgari queen nissa who shakes the world instants assassin trophy cast down vraska contempt lands swamp forest field of ruin overgrown tomb woodland cemetery sideboard davriel rogue shadowmage the elderspell carnage tyrant duress moment of craving thrashing brontodon buy this deck export text format export arena format while golgari superfriends utilizes the popular explore package with wildgrowth walker and friends make no mistake that this is planeswalker deck through and through nissa who shakes the world headlines this squad of heroes with her ability to pump your mana secondary to her ability to create an army of neverending creatures and they re not just they re much more as we will see liliana dreadhorde general is one of the most powerful cards in war of the spark and fairly obvious inclusion but vraska golgari queen finally steps into the limelight and makes major impact as well while vraska isn the most powerful planeswalker she has become much more useful in format that revolves around mana planeswalkers vraska excels at killing those dead making her welcome addition but the real twist is the proliferate subtheme evolution sage is magic card dripping with raw power there no limit to the proliferate mechanic meaning each land drop can be adding whole bunch of power and toughness to your board while also turbocharging your planeswalkers this pumps up your explore creature squad which is built around counters pushes your planeswalkers toward their ultimates and works unbelievably well with the creature lands that nissa creates because they are sized with counters they get to grow turn after turn as well it great mix of both worlds giving you the golgari midrange feel with whole new twist purple people war standard jim davis creatures fblthp the lost planeswalkers jace wielder of mysteries karn scion of urza ugin the ineffable dovin hand of control kasmina enigmatic mentor saheeli sublime

entrancing melody buy this deck export text format export arena format what if we wanted to smooth out our mana base and gain access to the amazing mobilized district as an additional threat that also attacked planeswalkers really well half mutavault half treetop village mobilized district is very powerful creature land that has some significant deck building requirements namely lot of legends luckily for us we already want legends for mox amber and jaya immolating inferno and also already packed our deck full of planeswalkers while staying only two colors loses us access to the pair of teferis it also gives us much smoother mana base and there are plenty of other heroes waiting to step in saheeli sublime artificer does fantastic job of gumming up the ground and making threats while also providing extra duty on huge sarkhan attack turns by turning servo into yet another dragon she also plays amazingly well with mox amber allowing you to make one or two tokens with her on turn three as you can play the mox amber and an opt shock or spell pierce for huge tempo swing karn scion of urza loves the artifacts while proving difficult to remove with jace wielder of mysteries serving similar role both shock and spell pierce are very well positioned right now with the format revolving around smaller value mana aggressive creatures and big planeswalker spells getting tempo in the early game so you can get the planeswalker train rolling is extremely important and both cards do great job of that while playing awesome with mox amber the big payoff however is the forgotten jaya immolating inferno before war of the spark the legendary sorceries were too risky to possibly leave stranded in your hand but with so many planeswalkers and fblthp help it is now very easy to flame wave your opponent board big fan of this one command the superfriends war standard jim davis creatures massacre girl paradise druid jadelight ranger merfolk branchwalker wildgrowth walker

sunpetal grove watery grave breeding pool hinterland harbor temple garden interplanar beacon overgrown tomb woodland cemetery sideboard cast down duress kraul harpooner narset parter of veils ritual of soot the elderspell thrashing brontodon buy this deck export text format export arena format our last superfriends deck is the most wild and believe was originally conceived by stanislav cifka and ivan floch yes once again we see the good old explore wildgrowth walker package however this time we re using the boatloads of life we gain for very different reason bring back all the planeswalkers and creatures too okay maybe not all of them but realistically are all of them really necessary spending six mana to add number of planeswalkers or powerful creatures to the battlefield is an exciting proposition and will end the game in your favor most of the time with your opponent needing to deal with wildgrowth walker and your planeswalkers you should have life to spare and your planeswalkers help to work to get you to that end once again we see teferi time raveler helping to keep the board clear and protect you from counterspells this time teaming up alongside vraska golgari queen who is also killing things and buying time however the real planeswalker prize is tamiyo collector of tales tamiyo does basically everything this deck wants she helps to find command the dreadhorde she helps to fill your graveyard she distracts your opponent to conserve your life and she can buy back valuable wildgrowth walker to make sure you have enough life for powerful command the dreadhorde that lot of value for four mana package the mana is held together with dual lands and interplaner beacon another cog in the lifegain puzzle to ensure good castings of command the dreadhorde and of course the explore creatures also help to ensure you find the lands that you need one thing to consider is adding the wanderer to the sideboard as not only does she help protect you against red decks and big green decks but if you cast command the dreadhorde with her in play you can get everything back as you take zero damage if there going to be combo deck in standard sure rather it look like this than simic nexus kryptonite it good thing wizards of the coast packed break in case of emergency box into war of the spark planeswalkers are the future of current standard we ve never seen format like this so make sure you are prepared either be bringing your own planeswalkers or having very good plan for dealing with your opponent planeswalkers burn spells that can target planeswalkers go up in value haste goes up in value as well as hard removal that can target planeswalkers like bedevil playing card like lava coil right now is very risky and of course if things get too crazy don be afraid to break the glass and kill em all
war of the spark has already had major impact on modern many of the new planeswalkers are seeing play across various decks with karn the great creator the big standout however the most wild card is simic uncommon that is nothing more than single birthing pod activation birthing pod is banned for reason neoform has combined with the forgotten coldsnap rare allosaurus rider to make putting griselbrand into play as early as turn one very real thing once griselbrand is in play you follow similar script to the goryo vengeance decks and use nourishing shoal to gain life which in turn turns into more cards and you rinse repeat until you draw your entire deck and kill your opponent with lightning storm or laboratory maniac whoa time stamps match match match match match neoform combo modern jim davis creatures laboratory maniac wild cantor autochthon wurm griselbrand allosaurus rider chancellor of the tangle simian spirit guide instants lightning storm noxious revival manamorphose dissenter deliverance nourishing shoal summoner pact sorceries eldritch evolution neoform serum visions lands island breeding pool botanical sanctum gemstone mine yavimaya coast sideboard chalice of the void defense grid engineered explosives leyline of sanctity pact of negation pongify rapid hybridization spell pierce buy this deck export text format in its present state this deck certainly feels similar to how goblin charbelcher decks feel in legacy capable of killing on turn one or two but ultimately fragile against strong interaction still the power level present here is undeniable we had good number of turn two and three kills and were very close to turn one kill in that last game the deck is going to need to learn how to adapt to the various forms of interaction and hate cards that can be leveled against it but make no mistake this deck is much more frightening than previous griselbrand decks that use goryo vengeance as their engine not using the graveyard and thus not being vulnerable to surgical extraction leyline of the void etc is huge plus it not there yet but there something very scary brewing here
our first big standard event with war of the spark is now behind us scg richmond gave us glimpse into what the future of standard is going to look like going forward and it was bit of mixed bag simic nexus loomed over the entire event and while it didn dominate its presence was heavily felt decks unable to compete with simic nexus were non starters and mono red aggro went on to have great day backed partly by an excellent matchup with nexus of fate decks esper control also had great day showing that success week one was seen on the polar ends of the format today we re gonna grade war of the spark planeswalkers based on how they looked in richmond paving the way from our pre tournament expectations to post tournament reality grade ah yes the dragon of the hour the big baddie thanos himself unfortunately nicol bolas was largely absent from scg richmond with the format so heavily polarized between nexus of fate esper control and mono red aggro that doesn leave much room for midrange decks to breathe the tools you need to compete against each deck are very different and for every enter the god eternals you add to help beat aggressive decks you have an extra dead card against control and nexus midrange decks can also struggle to put up enough of clock to stop control or nexus decks before they reach their endgame leaving most grixis decks to fall flat this is less an indictment on nicol bolas as card itself and more so just reaction to his place in the metagame there no doubt that nicol bolas is one of the most powerful cards in war of the spark but the metagame is currently very hostile toward him that is of course until things shift as they always do grade while the larger planeswalkers didn have great day in richmond the smaller ones did exceptionally well narset parter of veils had big day for pair of reasons it turns out dig through time is still great even if half of it is on suspend narset ability to dig deep and find the right card while also providing card advantage proved boon to both esper control decks as well as nexus of fate decks while not card you can play in high numbers due to it being bit slow an unwieldy narset was nonetheless an import cog in richmond but the card draw of course is not the only draw to narset narset static ability is very powerful against both control and nexus of fate decks providing difficult to remove annoyance that provides real card advantage as well as virtual card advantage narset is still probably better suited for older formats but will big serious player in standard going forward grade while didn end up finishing well with my planeswalker centric gruul aggro deck it was to no fault of my powerful trio of planeswalkers shaky mana base and too many matches against esper control did that sarkhan the masterless was an awesome threat that provided immediate board presence defended decently against go wide decks and quickly put away games where you already had planeswalker in play ramping any decent curve into sarkhan was often lights out the problem is that sarkhan lines up very poorly against both absorb and nexus of fate both cards that were running amok at scg richmond against control decks with counterspells sarkhan is five mana liability and if you are behind on cards they can just use two separate cards to kill the dragon token and sarkhan himself as he has no form of protection when he is creature while attacking for eight the following turn is nice sarkhan was also often too slow to get to nexus of fate player before they started to do their thing as such sarkhan is currently good planeswalker without home grade baby teferi follows similar story arc to narset parter of veils solid effect for three mana and decent source of card advantage but most importantly very punishing to the top decks in the format both esper control and nexus of fate decks hate to see teferi time raveler on the other side of the board as it throws major wrench into their plans by turning off counterspells the ability to play at instant speed and wilderness reclamation while also being fairly annoying to remove if you don have any creatures teferi time raveler is great foil to many of the format top decks of course like narset it also feels pretty anemic against aggressive red and white decks still teferi had huge day in richmond playing role in both esper control as well as esper midrange while also spearheading the team nova bant midrange deck that put two players into top while teferi is somewhat polarizing card depending on what the matchup is repulse isn that bad of fail state in matchups where he is poor grade three mana planeswalkers everywhere vivien champion of the wilds wasn everywhere in richmond but with full playset found in the breakout bant midrange deck she needs to be looked at more closely vivien asks lot she must be played in deck with large critical mass of creatures and not only that there has to be some sort of instant speed element to the deck or her flash static ability doesn really matter that much if your deck is all steel leaf champion and nullhide ferox you re not fooling anyone your opponents won attack into your open mana and will expect you to play something big on their end step by introducing elements like frilled mystic and mana sinks like growth chamber guardian and shalai voice of plenty you at least present number of options vivien also plays well with teferi severely limited your opponent timing options while maximizing yours vivien certainly needs specific deck to succeed but it looks like that deck has already been found grade as they say context is everything liliana dreadhorde general has all the makings of an absurd standard card she is highly reminiscent of elspeth sun champion and was on many top player best cards in the set lists so what happened frankly liliana is victim of context if all of your opponents are playing absorb nexus of fate or goblin chainwhirler liliana is underwhelming she not very fast clock if she can be removed or countered cleanly you don gain ton when you cast her and nexus of fate doesn care about or card advantage liliana will eventually rise but the format is extremely hostile toward her at the moment grade amusingly it was another sic mana planeswalker that saw little more time in the richmond spotlight ugin the ineffable while ugin seems to compare unfavorably to liliana in the raw power department he has one huge advantage if your opponent isn playing creatures and instead relying on non creature permanents like planeswalkers or enchantments as major part of their gameplan then ugin can come down and help break that up again context is everything and in the context of the present control nexus mono red format ugin is surprisingly more impactful grade speaking of context take quick look at the scg richmond winning list mono red aggro war standard will pulliam st place scg richmond creatures fanatical firebrand ghitu lavarunner goblin chainwhirler runaway steam kin viashino pyromancer planeswalkers chandra fire artisan instants wizard lightning lightning strike shock sorceries skewer the critics light up the stage lands mountain sideboard dire fleet daredevil lava coil legion warboss rekindling phoenix risk factor tibalt rakish instigator buy this deck export text format export arena format where are the experimental frenzies experimental frenzy has been the staple card in mono red aggro since its inception and is definitely more powerful card in vacuum than chandra fire artisan the problem again is that contextually experimental frenzy struggles in this specific format in ways that chandra fire artisan does not the format is extremely ready for another four mana enchantment wilderness reclamation and that splash damage hits experimental frenzy as well mortify teferi time raveler knight of autumn trashing brontodon return to nature etc chandra was the highlight of my gruul deck as well and there were few gruul decks in day two that were playing her that did well chandra isn as explosive but she very powerful planeswalker for any aggressive deck extra credit with so many more planeswalkers to explore we re still barely scratching the surface of war of the spark standard maybe you saw teyo the shieldmage in play on camera in the hands of ben ragen who saw that one coming it going to be interesting to see how the format evolves in the wake of scg richmond the nexus of fate mono red aggro esper control trifecta is tough one to beat with everything but new brews like the bant midrange deck give us hope that it can be beaten the rules are laid out it time to start trying to break them
gruul aggro has been part of standard for while now but it not really true gruul monsters deck with the mana base skewed so hard to play goblin chainwhirler the deck feels more like mono red deck with splash of green than anything else and plays out accordingly however goblin chainwhirler isn very effective against nexus of fate nicol bolas dragon god or teferi hero of dominaria the time of goblin chainwhirler has passed the time of llanowar elves is back again going fast is very important in this format you must be able to get under the nexus of fate decks as well as the control and midrange decks while being able to keep up with the aggressive decks sitting back isn an option there no faster card to play on turn one than llanowar elves and with suite of new great red planeswalkers we are off to the races time stamps match match match match match ahhhh gruul monsters war standard jim davis creatures dire fleet daredevil legion warboss paradise druid growth chamber guardian gruul spellbreaker llanowar elves rekindling phoenix planeswalkers chandra fire artisan domri anarch of bolas sarkhan the masterless instants lightning strike shock lands forest mountain rootbound crag stomping ground sideboard lava coil kraul harpooner thrashing brontodon carnage tyrant cindervines legion warboss dire fleet daredevil buy this deck export text format export arena format the new planeswalkers are great they re all powerful aggressive and most importantly durable giving your opponent fits when you assemble board quickly and top it off with planeswalker sarkhan tops off extremely well and if you ever cast him with planeswalker already in play you are off to the races we never got to do it but the turn one llanowar elves turn two domri turn three sarkhan curve is quite impressive with excellent sideboard cards like cindervines lava coil and kraul harpooner gruul can handle most things throw at it as said in the video like little more as far as anti aggro cards go and surprisingly tibalt rakish instigator fits the bill pretty well as double footlight fiend that also playable against control thrashing brontodon is also on the menu as large creature that can deal with either experimental frenzy or wilderness reclamation this video was recorded on the friday before scg richmond so nothing is set yet but this is currently my frontrunner for what will be playing in the event hopefully you re here because won it

washington david freese wasn in the los angeles dodgers starting lineup for game of the nl division series neither was kike hernandez or chris taylor all are right handed batters and all knew that if the washington nationals persisted in their playoff pattern of using starters in relief they might very well be called upon to pinch hit against million lefty patrick corbin so in the first inning sunday night that trio headed to the indoor batting cage that sits near the staircase leading from the visitors dugout to the clubhouse to try to prepare and boy were they prepared when corbin entered so were other dodgers hitters producing postseason inning unlike any other seven runs all scored with two outs and two strikes justin turner three run homer capped startling and record setting rally in the sixth as the dodgers roughed up the starter turned reliever and beat washington to grab lead in their best of five nlds we re just always ready no matter who on the mound righty lefty you ve got to fake it sometimes whether you re ready or not said freese who singled as pinch hitter in the sixth and finished with four hits definitely two strikes you ve got to take it seriously you can assume your ab over freese said you look at the best guys in the game they look like they like two strikes hernandez also entered in that inning and contributed two run double and taylor walked as pinch hitter against corbin russell martin started his first appearance of these playoffs and hit two run double in the sixth as la became the first team in major league history to score seven two out two strike runs in one postseason inning we never doubt ourselves freese said martin who like freese is tacked on two run homer in the ninth this is martin th postseason freese joked it might be his teammate th and freese sixth the dodgers can advance to the nl championship series for the fourth consecutive year by closing the best of five nlds in game at washington on monday when la sends rich hill to the mound against max scherzer and to think things were not looking all that good for the dodgers who entered the sixth trailing after juan soto two run homer off eventual winner hyun jin ryu in the first and max muncy solo shot off washington starter anibal sanchez in the fifth that seemed to wake up la offense well it was either that or the fact that sanchez who struck out nine was gone to begin the sixth in came corbin the lefty who started and lost the opener and hadn made relief appearance since when he only made one just couldn seem to get that third out there corbin said just stinks it continued nationals manager dave martinez postseason penchant for pushing his starters to appear in relief deemed necessary because of his club nl worst bullpen the strategy had been working needless to say not this time against the dodgers who lost in the world series each of the past two years and led the nl with wins this season more than the nationals anibal was at pitches he gave us all he had we were at good spot in the lineup where we thought corbin could get through it martinez said and his stuff was good but he had every hitter he just couldn finish after cody bellinger snapped his for start to the series with single he would add double later in the inning corbin struck out the next two hitters that when it all fell apart for washington freese the mvp of the nlcs and world series for st louis singled to put runners on the corners he has to be going down as one of the greatest october players of all time muncy said don care what anyone says he has to be martin came through on slider that landed on the warning track in left center putting the visitors ahead hernandez connected on slider for yet another two run double to left center hit off the base off the wall after muncy was intentionally walked wander suero entered and promptly served up full count fastball that turner lofted to the back of the visiting bullpen beyond left field making it couple guys came up and had really big at bats and that what we ve been doing all year muncy said that was one of those things where once one guy started doing it the next cat picked up on it and it just kind of rolled throughout the inning what relief with baseball era leader this season ryu done after going five innings and allowing two runs dodgers manager dave roberts pieced together the remaining outs with five relievers that included closer kenley jansen who hadn pitched in game since sept he threw ninth that included pair of strikeouts trainer room nationals cf victor robles was out of the lineup with strained right hamstring after getting hurt running to first base in game michael taylor started in robles place and went for up next three time cy young award winner scherzer was pushed back from game to game scherzer entered these playoffs with his teams having lost his most recent seven postseason appearances but washington is when he pitches so far this october including start in the nl wild card game against milwaukee and one inning three strikeout relief appearance in game at los angeles that bullpen use led the nationals to switch scherzer start from sunday to monday he can beat you in the strike zone with three pitches he can beat you out of the zone roberts said he relentless hill went with era this season in just starts he spent time on the il with sprained right knee and strained left forearm activated for the last time less than month ago hill hasn pitched more than three innings in an appearance since june pitch count whatever it is can control that the year old

ashburn va owner dan snyder and president bruce allen summoned coach jay gruden to the washington redskins facility before dawn monday to tell him he was being fired it was brief conversation allen said now comes longer conversation about the status of the floundering franchise that has won just two playoff games in snyder two decades of ownership and zero during allen tenure gruden is out after an start to his sixth season and is the latest in long line of redskins coaches to take the fall for significant organizational shortcomings to make decision like this is difficult but it was necessary allen said during minute news conference our start is not just disappointing we had much different expectations for the beginning of the season we owe it to our fans the organization the players the coaches and their families to do everything we can to win the redskins haven won much lately going overall under gruden with one playoff appearance in the season popular coach among players and smart offensive mind gruden struggled in preparing his teams washington went in season openers and lost win and get in game in week in against the new york giants who had nothing to play for despite never before being head coach in the nfl and despite never winning more than nine games in season gruden managed to stick around longer than anyone else who held that job during snyder unsuccessful stint as owner asked why snyder wasn addressing fans allen said because am snyder was not made available to reporters monday none of the six coaches hired since snyder bought the team has winning record including hall of famer joe gibbs and two time super bowl champion mike shanahan offensive line coach bill callahan becomes the seventh after he was selected to replace gruden on an interim basis callahan has coached the raiders in the nfl and nebraska in college football this is different territory for me callahan said it bittersweet in lot of ways had to replace veteran coach in jay and then to be asked to lead program now in week it uncharted waters for me this season alone has seen star left tackle trent williams hold out shuffle at quarterback after dwayne haskins was taken no overall in the draft series of injuries up and down the roster and perhaps most upsetting to team leadership increasingly large contingents of visiting fans attending games at washington home stadium all we can do is try to improve our product allen said these games we weren close in we ve lost five games and we didn lose them in the last second we lost these games decisively and we have to change that allen is right the redskins rarely have even been competitive ranking th out of nfl clubs in scoring averaging points and defense allowing points per game the only club that ranks worse than washington in both categories the miami dolphins will host the redskins next sunday cornerback quinton dunbar wrote on instagram that he owes gruden for life for helping him by switching him from wide receiver after college and added sorry we couldn get the job done for you gruden was fired the morning after loss to the defending champion new england patriots afterward gruden said he didn have concern about his job status with season remaining on his contract nobody told me anything gruden said if my key works on monday keep working instead gruden is gone and allen was asked repeatedly about his own job performance the redskins are with allen working in some capacity since allen said he doesn believe anybody is hiding from their record and took issue with questions about the organizational culture that has been the subject of widespread criticism you know the culture is actually damn good allen said these people care we have very young core of players that we have brought in here who are accustomed to winning if you look at the record of these guys they re accustomed to winning they want to win what working the brutal start to the redskins schedule is over and the even more hapless dolphins are up next what needs help everything on defense needs to be better but callahan said he won make any changes to his coaching staff including defensive coordinator greg manusky stock up adrian peterson better be ready to run callahan expressed desire to commit to the running game so an old school ground game is coming stock down haskins could be inactive as washington third quarterback sunday at miami with callahan saying the ohio state product will get his chance at some point injured tight end jordan reed remains out with concussion donald penn williams replacement at left tackle injured hamstring in the patriots game key number the redskins rushing attempts are the third fewest in the nfl next steps callahan will pick starting quarterback between case keenum and colt mccoy and alter the redskins practice habits more ap nfl https apnews com nfl and https twitter com ap nfl copyright by the associated press this story is from espn com automated news wire wire

the nfl is down to two unbeaten teams kansas city failed to do much on either side of the ball in home loss to indianapolis on sunday night leaving new england and san francisco as the league only teams without setback the ers host cleveland on monday night the chiefs had scored at least points in consecutive regular season games the longest streak in nfl history but the run ended with lackluster effort against the colts who dominated the line of scrimmage marlon mack had yards rushing finding holes against defense that lost tackles chris jones and xavier williams to injuries the colts were equally impressive against reigning league mvp patrick mahomes they spent most of the night in kansas city backfield stuffing the ground game and putting constant pressure on mahomes he was sacked four times hit more often and spent the final few minutes hobbling around arrowhead stadium we got beat in about every phase you can get beat this evening chiefs coach andy reid said mahomes finished with yards passing and touchdown the chiefs will try to regroup next week against houston which scored points the second most in franchise history in victory against atlanta here are some other things that happened during week of the nfl season still winless four teams remain without victory cincinnati washington miami and the new york jets at least one of them should snap out of their early season slump next week because the dolphins host the redskins for now though it the nfl most winless teams through week in decade kansas city st louis tampa bay and tennessee were winless after five weeks in each of them ended its drought in the next three games the bengals got the closest to winning sunday scoring two touchdowns in little more than minutes against arizona and tying the game at but rookie kyler murray drove the cardinals into position for the game winning field goal on the final play cincy problem was evident it allowed yards washington and the jets were downright dismal on offense the redskins scored on their second possession against new england getting yard run from receiver cam sims but did little else the redskins finished with yards and two turnovers the jets would have loved that kind of outburst considering they managed yards at philadelphia another injured qb pittsburgh steelers quarterback mason rudolph left the game against baltimore because of concussion caused by safety earl thomas hit to the chin trailing in the third quarter rudolph scrambled to his left stepped up the field and flicked the ball to teammate james washington just before the crown of thomas helmet hit rudolph under the chin rudolph limply fell to the ground and laid there with his eyes closed while medical personnel rushed to his side rudolph woozily made his way off the field and to nearby hospital for further evaluation he was the second steelers quarterback hurt this season starter ben roethlisberger is out for the year following elbow surgery carolina chicago jacksonville new orleans and the new york jets also are without their starting quarterback because of injury patriots roll tom brady passed brett favre for third place on the nfl all time passing list with yards brady now trails only retired peyton manning and injured new orleans star drew brees brady also edged closer to manning record touchdown passes with the th of his year career new england defense has been even better than its year old icon the pats are allowing points game better than two defenses widely considered the best in nfl history the chicago bears allowed points game and the baltimore ravens surrendered points game newsy nuggets mahomes reached yards passing in just the nd game of his nfl career becoming the fastest player to reach that milestone in the super bowl era he topped the previous mark by hall of famer kurt warner games dallas amari cooper notched his third game with at least yards receiving only calvin johnson and jerry rice have more in the super bowl era the jets have more defensive special teams touchdowns than offensive touchdowns this season houston deshaun watson posted perfect passer rating thanks to having the same number of passing touchdowns as incompletions more ap nfl https apnews com nfl and https twitter com ap nfl copyright by the associated press this story is from espn com automated news wire wire index recommend tweet email subscribe print comments
the nfl biggest trend so far in is well setting trends in its th season highlighted by all sorts of celebrations and honor what has become the nation most popular sport those trends tend to skew toward the negative side because this is supposed to be an uplifting season it worthwhile to take note of some of the more pleasant developments before examining those that have marred the first five weeks of the schedule for example the success of road teams is positive consider that the packers seahawks ravens and eagles have fallen at home the broncos are with mile high migraine in denver those are difficult places to play yet away teams are not counting sunday game in london allegedly home match for the raiders the chiefs patriots and bills already are as road teams as bill parcells frequently said while still coaching if you go on the road you should make the playoffs this trend actually might have begun last january when both conference title games were won albeit laden with controversy by the visitors the rams at new orleans the patriots at kansas city watching some high profile clubs and their stars soar early on is an upbeat trend so are the comebacks into the spotlight of teddy bridgewater watt and robert quinn but it far too easy to get inundated by the bad vibes created by damaging or unconstructive occurrences it can be argued that still the most mentioned name in pro football is someone out of the nfl antonio brown not only did the star wide receiver embarrass himself in three cities by forcing his way out of pittsburgh and oakland then getting cut by new england franchise that takes chance on virtually everyone brown also joined the parade of standout players set in motion by odell beckham jr of players poisoning their relationships with team to force trade elsewhere jadeveon clowney got his transfer out of houston jalen ramsey is playing that disturbing game now with the jaguars also disturbing is seeing so many empty seats in places such as washington cincinnati and all three florida nfl stadiums it only early october and using weather as an excuse is lame and inaccurate try mediocre of worse teams including one in miami that might not beat the nearby hurricanes as the cause maybe one of the things turning off those fans and this is valid is the proliferation of yellow flags so few games have any flow because of all the penalties and it dangerous development an emphasis on penalizing holding early in september so disrupted games that it made baseball seem fast paced in comparison that emphasis appears to have dissipated though there still are plenty of officials flags flying for that violation blaming the lack of on field work for regulars in the preseason was acceptable for few weeks but no longer and what about the perception that on field officials and the officiating office in new york won overturn an interference call on replay review when coach makes challenge as he is now allowed to do under trial rule adjustment resulting from the egregious non call in the nfc title game does the league or at the least those officials with whistles actually despise the rule so much that because interference is judgment call they simply won allow challenge to succeed perhaps the most worrisome trend in has been the epidemic of injuries to starting quarterbacks while some previous no qbs have been benched for poor performances consider that drew brees and ben roethlisberger likely hall of famers are on the sideline so are nick foles cam newton case keenum mitchell trubisky and sam darnold who should return from mononucleosis sometime this month on sunday roethlisberger backup mason rudolph took terrifying hit that knocked him out cold and caused concussion the jets also are down to their third stringer after trevor siemian went down in week with severe ankle injury not to leave bad taste in fans mouths about the nfl whose ratings are up amount of money gambled remains stratospheric and whose fantasy football attractiveness is through the roof consider that there tremendous battle for the no overall pick in next april draft folks of the bengals dolphins jets and redskins are considering any win in that race tantamount to elimination from it more ap nfl https apnews com nfl and https twitter com ap nfl copyright by the associated press this story is from espn com automated news wire wire index recommend tweet email subscribe print comments
kansas city mo the chiefs rolled into arrowhead stadium on sunday night knowing indianapolis was missing bunch of defensive backs to injuries and quite confident patrick mahomes could pick apart the colts backups turned out it was indianapolis that dominated bunch of kansas city second stringers one by one the chiefs lost crucial players on both sides of the ball and the colts took advantage of their flailing backups the result was victory not only ended kansas city incredible run of scoring at least points in straight games but also proved mahomes and co are fallible we got beat in about every phase you can get beat this evening chiefs coach andy reid said it wasn entirely their fault yes the chiefs were flagged times for yards yes they lost fumble when lesean mccoy had the ball poked loose deep in indianapolis territory yes their defensive backs kept getting beat by the fleet of colts wide receivers resulting in big completions or yet more penalties but those miscues often came with bunch of backups on the field wide receiver sammy watkins was the first to leave the game unable to press through hamstring injury that left him questionable to play at all he was joined on the sideline later by byron pringle who caught six passes for yards and score before ending up in the concussion protocol meanwhile top wide receiver tyreek hill took part in pregame warmups following his first week of practice since week but his collarbone injury is still healing and hill was again inactive you don ever know if man will go down so you got to know the playbook and be ready to step up pringle said it time to show what you ve been working hard for all week up front the chiefs already were missing left tackle eric fisher who underwent core muscle surgery and isn expected back for several more weeks then they lost left guard andrew wylie to an ankle injury forcing them to use two ineffective backups cam erving at tackle and ryan hunter at guard we have the best quarterback in the world the best receivers all that stuff chiefs right tackle mitchell schwartz said it was just matter of guys are getting there too soon erving in particular had miserable night he was dominated by the colts defensive front flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct for hit out of bounds and once was pushed so far back in the pocket that he stepped on mahomes left ankle leaving the league mvp to limp to the sideline things weren much better for the chiefs on defense middle linebacker anthony hitchens who has the defensive radio in his helmet and is responsible for getting everyone aligned left early with groin injury defensive linemen xavier williams ankle and chris jones groin departed later in the game seriously wounding the chiefs at the point of attack it was hardly surprising that the marlon mack ran for yards averaging more than yards pop and that the colts piled up yards and touchdown on the ground ve got to get the bigs playing better on both sides the offensive and defensive line it starts there reid said when you win it starts there when you lose it starts there too but it early in the season we ll come back and learn from this and some of these injuries we ll get healthy it can happen soon enough the chiefs are in the midst of brutal grind highlighted by four prime time matchups in six week stretch they play red hot houston next sunday then visit denver on short week followed by sunday night game against green bay visit from minnesota and monday night game against the chargers all before they get their bye and chance to really get healthy obviously we have to move on pretty quickly we re still early in the season said mahomes who dismissed the seriousness of his ailing ankle the same one he hurt in week against jacksonville this loss hurts lot but there long way to go this is something we ll learn from more ap nfl https apnews com nfl and https twitter com ap nfl copyright by the associated press this story is from espn com automated news wire wire index recommend tweet email subscribe print comments
kansas city mo the way indianapolis handled the kansas city chiefs on sunday night sent jolt through the nfl whether it was dominating the line of scrimmage or shutting down patrick mahomes and co on defense the one place the shock didn reverberate the visiting locker room in arrowhead stadium the one emotion we were not feeling is shock can even explain it colts coach frank reich said after the victory the way guys were walking down the hallway it was we re not going to be denied we have to get on track we ve got to do it just knew it was real felt it all week there was just an air of confidence and belief that we would do what we did today marlon mack ran for yards and ageless kicker adam vinatieri knocked through four field goals as the colts atoned ever so slightly for january playoff defeat inside the same stadium asked what the message was pregame longtime chiefs linebacker turned colts defensive end justin houston replied to come out here and play our game to leave it out there every snap to play with your heart play with your soul and think we did that tonight the colts allowed points on the chiefs first two possessions before shutting them out until harrison butker field goal with to go indianapolis recovered the onside kick without any issue and ran out the clock to celebrate big win heading into its bye mahomes threw for yards and touchdown and the chiefs had just yards rushing despite getting top running back damien williams back from an injury all while watching their record streak of straight games scoring at least points come to crashing conclusion penalties are really what hurt us today said chiefs coach andy reid whose team was flagged times for yards you get things going all of sudden you re going backward and it tough in this league to do that against good team and win in an air it out era of the nfl the colts also won by dominating the line of scrimmage on offense their big line bruised kansas city defensive front that lost chris jones and xavier williams to injuries that created big holes for mack and plenty of time for jacoby brissett who threw for yards while running for the colts only touchdown on defense the colts spent most of the night in the kansas city backfield plugging up holes in the running game and relentlessly pressuring the reigning league mvp on passing downs mahomes was sacked four times and hit plenty more at one point in the second half cam erving was pushed so far into mahomes face that the backup left tackle stepped on his quarterback ankle leaving mahomes to hobble to the sideline when kansas city was forced to punt in this league the margin of error is tiny said mahomes who dismissed the seriousness of his injury if you re not executing at high level you re going to lose the colts and chiefs mostly played to first half stalemate but the second of vinatieri four field goals made it at the break the real winners were the officials who finally got to rest the arms that they used to throw flags for the first minutes the chiefs prolific offense continued to sputter in the second half and brissett and the colts essentially played game of keep away throughout the third quarter and into the fourth you don need large playbook to convert third and chiefs defensive end frank clark said the colts used off the clock to move mere yards and set up vinatieri next field goal then when the chiefs failed to convert fourth and at their own indianapolis got another field goal from vinatieri with to go to make it two possession game you could just tell they were hungry they were hungry all week reich said know that not uncommon but there was something different about this week could feel it it was palpable we just walked in here with lot of confidence last night in our meetings can even explain what happened in our meetings last night there was just feeling amongst the team when we walked into this stadium almost int mahomes nearly threw his first interception of the season in the third quarter when fb anthony sherman batted pass and lb bobby okereke caught it review showed the ball bounced off the ground ring of honor the chiefs inducted ol brian waters into their hall of fame during halftime waters was two time all pro for kansas city before wrapping his year career with the patriots and cowboys happy returns colts de justin houston celebrated his first trip to kansas city as visitor by sacking mahomes in the first half the four time pro bowl pick had sacks during eight seasons with the chiefs flag day chiefs cb bashaud breeland had night to forget not only did he struggle in pass coverage he was flagged four times for yards that included yard pass interference call injuries colts cbs shak taylor chest and kenny moore ii knee left in the first half joining inactive safeties malik hooker knee glayton geathers concussion and rolan milligan knee on the indianapolis sideline lb zaire franklin hamstring and de kemoko turay ankle left in the

IMPACT: International Journal of Research in   Humanities, Arts and Literature (IMPACT: IJRHAL)  ISSN 2321-8878  Vol. 1, Issue 5, Oct 2013, 13-22  © Impact Journals     BHARATANATYAM: THE CRESCENDO OF NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION   Assistant Professor, Department of English, Jagan Nath University, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India   PREETI BALA SHARMA      ABSTRACT   Human beings have been expressing their complex and abstract feelings or emotions through non verbal forms of   communication. Dance is one of the greatest and special forms of non verbal communication. In dance, the human body is   used as a medium or instrument which transforms itself from the realm of movement to the realm of meaning. This paper is   an attempt to focus on dance as not only a tool of non verbal communication but also a tool of conveying a wide range of   stories, emotions, feelings, etc. symbolically and didactically.   KEYWORDS: Dance, Angika, Mudras, Gestures, Postures, Non Verbal Aspects of Communication in Dance   INTRODUCTION  Bharatanatyam: The Crescendo of Non Verbal Communication   Besides verbal form of communication, human beings use many behavioral patterns to make others understand   messages more clearly. These behavioral patterns can be visual, aural or gestural which speak more directly and clearly   than words because words have their own limitations:   “Words stain   Crack and sometimes break,   Under the burden; under the tension,   Slip slide, perish, decay with impression.” (T.S. Eliot. 207)   Therefore,  most  of  the  times  we  rely  on  pitch,  tone,  gestures,  postures,  facial  expressions  or  eye  contacts,                      i.e.  non  verbal  form  of  communication,  to  convey  what  we  want  to.  We  receive  a  lot  of  information  intentionally  or   unintentionally just by looking at whatever happens around us.    Fine Arts: One of the Greatest Forms of Non Verbal Communication   There are various forms of non verbal communication. A fine art is one of the greatest forms of communication in   the  world  though  which  many  abstract,  invisible  or  complex  feelings  and  emotions  can  be  expressed  easily.  The  artists   symbolize the  intended  messages and codify them and allow the spectator or viewer to decode and interpret the hidden   messages or meanings. The vehicle they use to convey reaches simultaneously to the mind and the heart of the beholders   and the language they use is the language of imagery, symbolism, gesture or body movements.   Dance: Representative of All Arts   Many artists and scholars believe that among various forms of fine arts, dance art was the very first fine art.    As  we  all  know,  the  impulse  of  dance  is  inborn,  and  is  capable  of  solving  many  purposes.  It  serves   communication  as  a  common  language  of  signs  and  movements  through  which  one  is  not  only  able  to  express  one’s   sentiments,  emotions  or  feelings  but  can  also  release,  elevate  or  understand  inner  conflicts,  tensions,  fears,  aspirations,             14     hopes or ideals. According to Krishna Sahai dance is, “… a harmonious expression that reveals the inner nature of things,  regardless of the subject, where the theme, expression, contact and form are in balance.” (12)                  Preeti Bala Sharma                        Being  the  very  first  visual  commentary  on  concrete  manifestations  of  thought  and  composite  form  of  all  arts,   dance  can  be  regarded  as  a  representative  of  all  arts  to  understand  the  culture  of  a  society  as  it  has  been  used  as  an   important medium to preserve, perpetuate and develop the experiences, knowledge, culture or customs of society from one   generation to another.    Dance in India   In India, dance has been an integral part of every performing art and the very essence of cultural performances.   Laban has rightly said,   “The dance is the mother of the art. Music and poetry exist in time, painting and architecture in space. The creator   and the thing created, the artist and the work are still one and the same thing. Rhythmical pattern of movement, the plastic   sense of space, the vivid representation of a world seen and imagined, and these things man creates in his own body in the  dance, before he uses substance and stone and word to give expression to his inner experiences.” (Bruce 1)   In India, the panorama of Indian classical dances provides an answer to the unique, yet diverse cultural heritages   of the different regions. It seems to uphold the truth behind the statement of ‘unity in diversity’ and the saying from the   Upanishad i.e. ‘the ultimate Truth is one but the paths leading to it are many’ (ekam sat viprah bahube vadanti)’.   Evolution of Indian Dance   As far as the evolution of dance is concerned, traditional Indian studies and scholars accept that human beings   have always been overwhelmed by the beauty of creation, which had infused the feeling of humility before the unknown   ‘power’ behind all creations on this earth and inspired them to express themselves before the unknown power. This urge to   express or communicate their beliefs, emotions or beautiful feelings gave birth to dance form. This unshakable faith and   urge to worship the divine power found expression through dance. So, Indian classical dances are, by and large, a vivid   narration of the moods, passions, tales, legends and exposition of philosophies and above all, a devotional offering which   uplifts both the spectators and the performer.   Bharatanatyam Dance   The art of Indian classical dances like Kathak, Manipuri, Kathakali, and Bharatanatyam and so on is believed to   be originated in heaven, and later on took different shapes. Although first two are the reflections of Hindustani music and   other two are of Karnatic music, yet all of them are governed more or less by the principles and techniques enunciated in   the Natya Shastra written by Bharata Muni.       Figure 1    Bharatanatyam: The Crescendo of Non Verbal Communication                                            15   Bharatanatyam: The Dance of Bharata   Although Bharata Muni’s Natya Shastra is a source of all Indian classical dances, yet Bharatanatyam dance has an   important place because it is considered as the dance of Bharata and a harmonious blending of ‘bhava’, ‘raga’, and ‘tala’.   Bharatanatyam dance is not only a dance form but also a source of expression of the greatest joy and fulfillment. It is the   superlative form of the Indian classical dances involving all the aspects of dance, drama and music in it. In the words of   Krishna Sahai,   “A Bharatanatyam performance is not just the culmination of years of practice and training, nor yet a symbol of   tradition  that  fades  into  mythology.  It  is  a  visual  interpretation  of  all  the  arts  of  India,  of  music  and  rhythm,  literature,   poetry,  sculpture  and  painting.  It  is  a  mirror  of  universe,  reflected  through  a  series  of  emotional  states.  It  is  the  final  worship.” (147)   This  explanation  shows  that  Bharatanatyam  is  the  most  sophisticated  dance  form  with  the  intricacies  of  facial   expression,  gestures,  footwork  and  costume.  Therefore,  it  touches  every  possible  aspect  of  non  verbal  form  of   communication. When Bharatanatyam is performed, it appears as if   “The dancer disappears and only the dance remains.   Then the dancer is the dance.   There is no dancer separate from the dance,   No dance separate from the dancer.   This is unio mystica.” (Osho, Acharya Rajneesh) (Sahai 147)   Non Verbal Aspects of Communication in Bharatanatyam   Bharatanatyam is a classic blend of Nritta (rhythmic elements), Nritya (combination of rhythm with expression)   and Natya (dramatic elements).This blend is known as ‘Abhinaya’.    Abhinaya  is  the  rhythmic  expression  of  moods,  emotions  and  a  narrative  through  the  use  of  mudra                              (hand  gestures),  rasa  (facial  expression)  and  Bhanga  (postures  of  the  body).  It  literally  means  the  ‘representation  or   exposition  of  a  certain  theme’.  Abhinaya  is  derived  from  the  Sanskrit  root  ‘NI’  meaning  ‘to  convey’  or  ‘to  lead’.                         So Abhinaya is a state of being or feeling’. Abhinaya has four means of communication:    •  Angika i.e the language of expression through the medium of the body, the face and movements;    •  Vacika, i.e. the expression through words, literature or drama and their delivery;    •  Aaharya, i.e. the expression through decoration such as proper costume, ornaments and make up; and    •   Sattvika, i.e. the expression through acting out and manifesting the different states of mind and feelings or internal   emotions.    So we can surmise here that abhinaya is not only an art of acting, but also an artistic process by which sentiments   (bhavas) of a feeling or emotions are produced. In its rendering, the dancer has to follow one basic principle, i.e. every   action of one side of the body must have equilibrium of other side of the body.   Among  these  four  aspects  of  nonverbal  communication,  the  angika  abhinaya  is  the  visible  form  of   communication  through  bodily  gestures  and  facial  expression  that  is  why  it  is  primarily  considered  to  be  a  nonverbal          16     communication  mode.  ‘Angika  abhinaya  is  the  use  of  artistic  gestures.  Its  rules  regulate  the  actors’  bearing,  walk  and                  Preeti Bala Sharma                           movements of features and limbs’. (Natya Shastra. Viii. 11-15.)   As Angika means ‘of the limbs’, i.e. every part of the body capable of movement; that is why it is normally known   as mime with a comprehensive sign language-a language of gesture’ Petronius Arbiter rightly said,   “From a man’s face, I can read his character, if I see him walk, I know his thoughts.” (Burnaby 76)   The dance of Bharatanatyam depicts each and every object or emotion through gestures and body language. It is a   gestural language reflecting a thorough knowledge of whole universe. The dancer uses her body as a language to express   most mundane to the most abstract concepts or the most common to the uncommon emotions and feelings.    Head Gestures as Important Aspect of Communication in Bharatanatyam   The  head  gestures  according  to  Natya  Shastra  (Chapter:  viii)  are  of  thirteen  kinds  while  Nandikeshwara  in   Abhinayadarpanam mentioned only nine kinds. The Sama (level) is the head gesture, when the head is motionless but not   bent  or  raised  up,  denotes  not  only  the  beginning  of  nrtya  but  also  anger,  pride,  satisfaction  and  cessation  of  action.                  The  nodding  head  (Kampita  movement)  is  assigned  to  the  head  shaken  up  and  down  slowly  denoting  assert,  direct   perception, conversation, enquiry, asking a question or innocence, etc. Alolita, i.e. rolling movement of the head indicates   distress, intoxication, frenzy or unwillingness, hesitation, obsession or sleeplessness, etc., whereas Adhomukha  when the   head is bent down denotes salutation, shame, grief and modesty. These head gestures can even be found in ordinary body   language.   Neck Movements as Important Aspect of Communication in Bharatanatyam   Besides  the  head,  neck  movements  are  also  peculiar  in  Bharatanatyam  dance.  In  Natya  Shastra,  Bharata  Muni   mentions that, ‘gestures of the neck are to follow the gestures of the head, and the head gestures are also reflected in those  of the neck.’ (165-66)Nandikeshwara in his book Abhinayadarpanam includes neck in Anga’s while in other treatises it is  included  in  Pratyanga.  Sundari,  Tiraschina,  Parivartita  and  Prakampita  are  mentioned  in  Abhinayadarpanam.                          The  Sundari  movement,  where  the  neck  is  moved  horizontally,  denotes  the  beginning  of  affection,  effort,  completion,   width  and  approval  with  pleasure  while  Tiraschina,  upward  movement  of  the  neck  on  both  sides,  is  indicative  of   brandishing of a sword and the gliding of the serpent. The third neck gesture is Paivartita where the neck moves from right   to left like a half moon, communicates kissing the cheeks and erotic dances, whereas the fourth kind, i.e. Prakampita, like   a pigeon’s neck, moves forward and backward, denotes you and I, swings, murmuring and counting.   Chest Movements as Important Aspect of Communication in Bharatanatyam   In the Natya Shastra, Bharata describes five chest movements ‘the natural pose of equipoise: drawn in, in sorrow,   fear, shame and  modesty; heaved up in pride, courage and anger; raised, in viewing lofty objects, in yawning, and high  purposes; shaken or flexed back and forth in weeping or laughter, or flexed rhythmically in the dance.’ (Ragini Devi 36)   In Natya Shastra, ‘in the exposition of sentiments the movements of the eyelids, lips, cheeks, nose or nostrils and   chine’ are classified and concisely defined.    Facial and Eye Movements as Important Aspect of Communication in Bharatanatyam   Among these parts of the face, eyes are given much importance in many treatises on dance and drama. The reason   behind this is that in order to collect information, we normally look at the face of another person particularly in eyes as  they are a window to the soul. Shakespeare wrote: “thou tallest me there is murder in mine eyes” (Lee Act 3, Scene V).    Bharatanatyam: The Crescendo of Non Verbal Communication                                            17      In Indian classical dances, the movement of the eyes along with eyebrows and eyelids play a very significant role   and thereby serve two purposes: the one is that they focus on the attention of the spectators on the dancer and the second is   that it enables the dancer to communicate her inner life. For example when Lord Shiva in His Raudra form opens His third   eye on the forehead out of anger, it annihilates anything and everything. Therefore, eyes are one of the most reliable and   dominant  features  of  body  language  which  helps  in  conveying  the  emotions  like  hate,  fear,  guilt,  love,  support  and   confidence etc.    In  Natya  Shastra,  thirty  six  different  glances  and  in  Abhinayadarpanam,  a  variety  of  glance  movements  are   described.  For  an  instance,  the  Avalokita  glance,  i.e.  looking  down,  is  used  to  look  at  a  shadow,  bed,  study,  reflection,   exercise, fatigue, etc. whereas Nimilita, i.e. closed eyes, denotes a snake, meditation, salutation, lunacy, muttering, being   under another man’s power or keen observation.    In the same way other eye glances also communicate specific messages or sentiments. Like eye glances, eye balls   are also significant in the Bharatanatyam. Their circular movement expresses passion, fury or valor while the vertical and   horizontal  movements  are  indicative  of  wonder,  emphasis,  divine  matters  and  heroism,  fear,  direction,  mystery   respectively.  So  it  is  very  clear  that  the  rhythmic  movements  of  the  eyes  either  semicircular  or  horizontal  help  in   beautifying pure dance.   Hand Gestures as Important Aspect of Communication in Bharatanatyam   Hands or Hasta Mudras constitutes one of the most important topics in the practice and theory of Bharatanatyam.   Although  being  highly  complicated  part  of  angika  abhinaya,  the  hasta  mudras  of  Bharatanatyam  are  a  very  highly   developed aspect of art and are a means of communication with the Divine. Nandikeshwara emphasizes its importance in   the following way, “Where the hand goes, the eye follows, where the eye goes, the mind follows and where the mind goes,   rasa is born.” (Ragini Devi 43)   Therefore, hand gestures play a very significant role in producing Rasa. They are a kind of sign language which is   used for a variety of reasons such as to bring out inherent qualities, to convey deeper feelings, to mime the meaning of   songs or to invoke the  myriad forms of the Divine.  So, hasta  mudras help to describe elaborately any topic, idea or the   mental  state  of  the  dancer.  Natya  Shastra  and  Abhinayadarpanam  list  numerous  mudras  with  their  meanings.  In  the   Bharatanatyam dance there are two kinds of Hasta  mudras: 1:  Asamyutha hasta i.e single hands and 2:  Samyutha hasta              i.e. combined hands and sometimes Nritta hasta i.e. hands used only in nritta or pure dance. In Natya Shastra28 and in   Abhinayadarpanam24 Asamyuta hasta mudras are described:   Pataka Tripatakordhapataka Kartareemukhaha   Mayurakyordhachandrashcha Arala Shukatundakaha   Mushtishta Shikarakyashcha Kapitha Katakamukhaha   Suchee Chandrakala Padmakosham Sarpashirastata   Mrugasheersha Simhamukho Langulasolapadmakaha   Chaturo Bramarashchiva Hamsasyo Hamsapakshakaha   Samdamsho Mukulashchiva Tamrachooda Trishoolakaha   Ashtavimshatihastha Naam Evam Naamaanivikramat. (M. Ghosh 93)                                                 Preeti Bala Sharma   18      Figure 2      As mentioned in connection with ‘Asamyuta hasta’, Samyuta hastas are listed which again vary from one dance   treatise  to  another.  Natya  Shastra  and  Lasya  Ranjana  mention  thirteen  and  Abhinayadarpanam  mentions  twenty  three   Samyuta hastas which are as follows:   Anjalishcha Kapotashcha Karkata Swastikastatha   Dolahastha Pushpaputaha Utsanga Shivalingakaha   Katakavardhanashchiva Kartaree Swatikastata   Shakata Shankha Chakrecha Samputa Pasha Keelakau   Matsya Koorma Varahashcha Garudonagabandakaha   Khatwa Bherundakakhyashcha Avahitastathivacha   Chaturvimshatisankhyakaha Samyuta Katithakaraha. (M. Ghosh 104)   Figure 3       Bharatanatyam: The Crescendo of Non Verbal Communication                                            19   These numbers do not matter at all. What matters is this idea that the hand gestures communicate the ideas clearly   and along with the facial expression, they play a very significant role in delineates particular meaning or information of the   dancers. For an instance, the alapadma hand gesture, when held high above the head in the left hand, is symbolic of sun:   When a little lower with the right in suchi mukha towards it, then it signifies a palace or city:    Figure 4      Figuer 5    Figure 6         Another famous hasta mudra is Shikhara hasta mudra, a closed fist with the thumb up, is used to symbolize the   manifestations of the Divine power. It also symbolizes success, triumph, a pillar, making offering to manes, the upper lip,     a tooth, questioning, something entered, saying no, recollection or the act of embrace and sounding a bell.   Nandikeshwara  in  Abhinayadarpanam  describes  the  variety  of  hasta  mudras  and  their  uses.  Pataka  mudra  in   which the thumb is bent to touch the fingers, and the fingers extends, is indicative of “the beginning of a natya and denotes          20     the clouds, a forest, forbidding things, bosom, night, a river, region of gods, the horse, cutting, wind, lying down, attempt at                  Preeti Bala Sharma                           going, prowess, favour, moonlight, strong sunlight, forcing open doors, meaning of seven case-endings, wave, entering a   street,  equality,  anointing  the  body  of  one’s  oneself,  taking  an  oath,  silence,  palmyra  leaf,  shield,  touching  things,   benediction,  the  ideal  king,  saying  ‘such  a  such  place’,  the  sea,  succession  of  good  deeds,  addressing  a  person,  going  forward, holding a sword, a month, a year, a rainy day and cleaning with broom.” (Ghosh 52-53)   Through hand gestures the dancers form a language and through the words of this language they can depict the   whole universe.   Postures as Important Aspect of Communication in Bharatanatyam   Besides these kinds of gestures, another area of importance is the postures or stances. In Shilpa Shastra the ideal   posture of the body is depicted which are four in number. The postures are normally called Bhangas in Indian culture as it   shows the deviation of the body from the central erect position. The first posture is Abhanga which signifies ‘off-centre’ or   the body slight bend with one hip raised gracefully and the weight of the body is supported by one leg only. The second   posture is sambhanga where the equal bend of equipoise is assigned. Atibhanga, the third posture, is the great blend with   the torso diagonally inclined and the knees are bent whereas the fourth and the last posture is Tribhanga which means the   triple bend with one hip raised while the torso curved the opposite side and the head is tilted at an angle.   The emotions are shown through bodily movements and gestures, as they are universal signs or symbols and it is   not very difficult for spectators to understand the symbolic representation of dancer ‘using the body with hand gestures to   convey ideas… the language of body and hand gesture can be approached in three ways. One way is to describe a situation   as narrator. Another is to become the various characters. In the third approach, the dancer becomes an object or a natural  phenomenon- say, a tree, a creeper, a breeze, a storm, rain, a river, etc.’ (The Hindu 2).    So it can be  said  here that the above  mentioned all  movements of angika abhinaya,  when combined  with each   other from head to toe, evolve into a further unit of movements i.e. ‘nritta’.   CONCLUSIONS   In  this  way  the  exploitation  of  the  modes  of  nonverbal  communication  is  clearly  seen  through  the  concept  of   Abhinaya,  revealing  the  Indian  classical  dances  as  a  heightened  sense  of  communication. This  also  realizes  that  what  a   human body is capable of doing when with the help of bodily organs, it shows the expressive movements. So it can be   surmised here that Indian classical dances like Bharatanatyam are the crescendo of nonverbal communication. It is relevant   to quote Bharata Muni here, who said,   “There is no wisdom, nor knowledge; no art nor craft; no device, nor action that is not found in Natya.”   Bharatanatyam,  in  the  most  refined,  enjoyable,  pleasing,  joyful  and  beautiful  manner  attains  the  highest  form  of   communication without words. Here both what and how are not different things but one and the same thing and ‘what is   said’ is said via ‘how it is said’.   REFERENCES   1.  Moody, A.D. (1994). The Cambridge Companion to T. S.

Abstract:  This  qualitative  research  paper  intends  to  examine  the  socio-cultural  pedagogies  in  Bharatanatyam.   As an attempt to educate non-Bharatanatyam dancers and dance education researchers, this study focuses on an  extensive  literature  review  including  data  driven  studies  and  position  papers.    Bharatanatyam,  learned  using  socio-cultural  tenets  is  a  valuable  Asian  Indian  artistic  and  transnational  literacy  tool.  This  paper  is  also  an  attempt to analyze studies on ballet and flamenco and other scholarly and researched articles on Bharatnatyam.  Absence  of  cognitive  benefits  of  Bharatanatyam  in  research  studies  and  scholarly  articles  impacts  dance  education and Asian Indian children living in the west.  Key Words: Bharatanatyam, Socio-cultural interaction, dance education, Asian Indian, transnational literacy   Bharatnatyam and Transnational Literacy Through Socio-cultural Pedagogy         Figure 1:Navarasas in Bharatanatyam        Perspective: Bharatanatyam enables the dancers to portray the nine emotions as described in Asian Indian  aesthetic theory (Dutta, 2008). Navarasas are the nine emotions (nava is nine in Sanskrit). These sentiments,  acquired through socio-cultural pedagogy, are portrayed in several of the dance sequences in Bharatanatyam.  These emotions enable the audiences to experience catharsis while watching a theatrical or dance performance.  The nine emotions are not taught using text or curriculum, but they are incorporated into dance lessons through  socio-cultural instructions during Bharatanatyam choreography. The nine emotions are sringara/love,  hasya/comic, bhayanaka/fear, shanta/peace, adhbute/wonder, karuna/pity, rowdra/anger, and veera/bravery  (Bhavani and Bhavani, 2001). According to Kushwaha (1994), the audience will be able to reachshanta (peace)  rasa after they experience the other eight rasas.   This research paper intends to examine the socio-cultural instructional practices that facilitate learning  through Bharatanatyam. This project is an attempt to educate non-Bharatanatyam dancers and dance education  researchers to consider Bharatanatyam, learned using socio-cultural instruction, as a valuable transnational  literacy tool. The researcher attempts to situate Bahratanatyam in the literature by extensively analyzing studies  in scholarly and researched articles on dance including the widely popularized ballet and flamenco dances.   Purpose        www.iosrjournals.org                                                    50 | Page    Bharatanatyam and Transnational Literacy Through Socio-Cultural Pedagogy   1. How does the absence of Bharatanatyam and skills enhancement in research studies and scholarly articles  impact dance education?   Research Question      Theoretical Framework     This articles draws on Socio-cultural tenets involved in learning. Steiner and Mahn (2009) prophesized  vygotskian  socio-cultural  premise,  “Physical  tools  are  directed  toward  the  external  world;  psychological  tools  are directed internally and are appropriated during activity” (p.1). Steiner and Mahn (2009) elaborate on three of  vygotsky‟s  socio-cultural  doctrines.  One  of  the  tenets,  “semiotic  mediation”  is  vital  in  co-construction  of  knowledge and this is an important component in socio-cultural model of learning:   Vygotsky (1981) listed a number of examples of semiotic means: "language; various systems  of counting; mnemonic techniques; algebraic symbol systems; works of art; writing; schemes,  diagrams, maps and mechanical drawings; all sorts of conventional signs and so on" (p. 137).      Hence, artistic activities also function as „mediating tools‟ in learning.   Socio-cultural  and  cognitive  psychologists  such  as  Galperin  (2003)  assert  that  an  individual  acquires  knowledge  “through  internalization  and  transformation  of  socially  constructed  shared  activities”  (Arievitch,  p.  284).  Two  good  examples  of  socially  constructed  performance  arts  are  the  Indian  dance  and  music  programs.  These two art forms are important popular cultural practices with Asian Indian people living in America. These  are derived from practices that are engaging and entertainment pedagogy (Denzin, 2009) that Steiner and Mahn  (2009)explained:   Other  tools,  increasingly  recognized  in  socio-cultural  discourse  --  the  paint  brush,  the  computer,  calendars, and symbol systems -- are central to the appropriation of knowledge through representational  activity by the developing individual (P. 4).   involves   Bharatantanatyam   intricately  codified  and  stylized  bodily  movements,  schematized  expressions,  and  story  telling  using  music.  The  dancer  becomes  the  teacher  who  guides  the  audiences  about  what  the  artist  is  dancing  to.  These  qualities  needed  for  performance  is  learned  through  socio-cultural  instructions,  internalization  of  the  character‟s  personality,  and  narrative  modes;  therefore,  sociological,  psychological, and intellectual aspects are needed for optimal performance (Graham, 2011).  Galperin‟s theory  deals with psychology in learning, but Arievitch‟s critical analysis of Galperin enables the readers to recognize  how  the  west  has  neglected  Galperin‟s  contribution  to  psychology,  especially  the  socio-cultural  aspects  of  the  human mind. Lave, Wenger, &Rogoff  (2003) have recognized this importance of collaboration in learning that  Galperin  vouches.  The  socially  constructed  shared  activity  in  learning,  which  is  the  premise  of  socio-cultural  learning  model,  is  evident  in  Bharatanatyam  instruction.  Bharatnatyam  is  a  culturally  driven  object-driven  activity. Galperin‟s approach to learning where action is process oriented and socially and culturally mediated,  is  these  socio-cultural  pedagogies.Analyzing, Graham‟s study on the relationship between dance education and intellectual, social, and  emotional literacies, we can elevate our understanding of the educational advances through Bharatanatyam.   the  premise  of  socio-cultural  processes.  Bharatantayam   taught  using   is      I.   Introduction   Bharatanatyam  –  bha/expression,  ra/rhythm,  ta/beat,  and  natya/dance  is  an  interdisciplinary  dance  form  that  originated  in  the  state  of  Tamil  Nadu  in  south  India.  It  is  a  co-curricular  activity  that  is  familiar  to  people of  Asian  Indian  origin. This  dance  is  not  addressed  in  the  US  school  curriculum  because  Asian  Indian  students  are  a  minority  in  America  and  dance  education  in  general  is  neglected  in  our  educational  system.  According to Risner (2010), “ … I became more and more miffed that so little attention is paid to the status and  well  being  of  postsecondary  dance  education  in  the  United  States”  (p.  133).  Overall  dance  education  is  not  venerated in our school curriculum and Bharatanatyam is not visible in US schools although many Asian Indian  people utilize this style of dance to teach their young adults.   A  Bharatanatyam  dancer  is  a  transnational  interpreter,  who  helps  teach  Asian  Indian  students  about  their culture, religion, history, heritage, and literature through the medium of dance. Risner (2010) rightly posits  that, “Historically, dance and dance education have shared important social bonds with their communities, both  by  definition  and  out  of  necessity”  (p.  127).  Bharatanatyam,  learned  using  socio-cultural  instruction  teaches  valuable social and language skills incidentally along with helping Asian Indian students use this dance form as  transnational  literacy.  O‟Shea  (2003)  claims  that,  “The  dance  form  operates  as,  in  ArjunAppadurai‟s  (1996)  terms,  intentional  cultural  productions  for  non  resident  Indians  in  places  as  Los  Angeles,  Singapore,  and  Manchester” (p. 178).    www.iosrjournals.org                                                    51 | Page    Bharatanatyam and Transnational Literacy Through Socio-Cultural Pedagogy   II.  My Positionality   Unlike my husband and I who grew up in India, our children are growing up in the west (USA), where  technology,  theme  parks,  video  games,  TV,  movie  theaters,  and  dinner  get-togethers  are  some  of  the  popular  entertainment  prospects.  Our  family  appreciates  traditional  Asian  Indian  culture  and  we  rely  on  dance,  music,  and  theater  as  alternate  platforms  for  both  entertaining  and  educating  our  children.  Art  forms  such  as  Bharatnatyam and Carnatic music are transnational literacy tools some Asian Indian parents trust to teach their  children  about  their  roots.  Based  on  my  observations,  my  children  resisted  these  options  at  times  due  to  peer  pressure, ridicule, and absence of the Asian Indian arts at schools and in mainstream society in the US. However,  once internalized through parents‟ model, teachers‟ commitment, and other Asian Indian children‟s involvement,  they  seem  to  accept  and  enjoy  the  Asian  Indian  art  forms.  As  young  adults,  they  recognize  the  value  in  these  performing arts because dance and music create an environment for cultural growth and provide children with a  space to construct their Asian Indian identities (Iyengar, 2014). Bharatanatyam also involves family, community,  and teacher support and hence this dance style is appropriate for cooperative learning. Our family attends music  concerts  and  dance  performances  once  or  twice  a  month  depending  on  the  program  availability.  My  daughter  and  I  learn  this  expressive  dance  style  at  Natyanjali  Center  for  Performing  Arts  directed  by  Mrs.  BanaShastriRamanath. I learn to revitalize my heritage and stay connected to my roots, but my goal is to help  my  children  acquire  Asian  Indian  cultural,  religious,  and  historical  values  through  socio-cultural  instructions  during Bharatanatyam and Carnatic classes including stage performances.    I  consider  Bharatanatyam,  a  valued  out-of-school  activity,  is  a  conducive  vehicle  that  enables  my  children and my Balavikas(Hindu Sunday School) students to learn about India. For example, dance drama on  the Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, where Bharatnatyam dancers tell the quest stories of Prince Rama  and the Kaurava and Pandava family  feud respectively through dance sequences is appealing to  young adults.  Understanding these epics through performing arts is engaging compared to reading these stories using printed  texts. My own research is on Bharatanatyam as transnational literacy and skills acquired through socio-cultural  instructions.  How  do  we  Asian  Indians  teach  our  young  adults  living  outside  India  their  rich  culture,  religion,  and  heritage  without  dance  education?  This  study  is  especially  important  to  me  because  my  children  spend  about two hours every week learning Carnatic music and Bharatantayam because I believe that these arts have  an impact in terms of cognitive, emotive, and social skills enhancement in children (Iyengar, 2014). In addition,  this is a convenient and  productive  medium to teach children about Asian Indian culture, religion, and history  and these art forms address all of these aspects by engaging children who are transnational. The following figure  illustrates Bharatantyam choreography.   Figure 2: Kalakshetra Dancers   III.   Interdisciplinarity      [Bharatanatyam  enables  Asian  Indian  Americans]  involve  their  home,  social  worlds,  networks,  social  interactions,  and  community  (Moll,  Amanti,  Neff,  and  Gonzalez,  1992).  Bharatanatyam  is  also  an  interdisciplinary Asian Indian art form that integrates key elements from different disciplines such as semiotics,  music, mathematics, philosophy, history, religion, sociology, anthropology, art, aesthetics, cognitive psychology,  and  cultural  studies.  Bharatanatyam  incorporates  knowledges  from  different  disciplines  to  produce  an  artifact  aesthetically  pleasing  and  appealing  to  the  audiences‟  senses  and  intellect.  The  different  disciplines  have  to  come  together  to  synthesize  beautiful  artifacts  and  this  interdisciplinary  synthesis  paves  way  to  “cognitive  promotion through integration” (Mansilla, 2007). Bharatanatyam also uses culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP).  Research  has  established  that  culturally  relevant  pedagogy  connects  diverse  children‟s  home  environment  and  scholastic  life  and  encourages  cultural  competence  in  children  (Landson-Billings,  2005)  and  such  pedagogies  may act as literacy agents, especially in upholding their culture.           www.iosrjournals.org                                                    52 | Page    Bharatanatyam and Transnational Literacy Through Socio-Cultural Pedagogy   IV.   Learning Environment   Bharatanatyam  is  an  engaging  co-curricular  performing  arts  activity  that  many  Asian  Indian  children  practice  early  on  in  life  to  conserve  their  culture.  However,  this  dance  is  not  addressed  in  US  schools.  In  the  absence  of  school  curriculum,  socio-cultural  activities  are  what  propel  diverse  students  to  learn  about  their  background, history, culture, and religion. Bhartanatyam creates such a learning environment for Asian Indian  children growing up in western countries.Risner (2010) is an ardent believer of post secondary dance education  and  argues  that,  “…dance  is  significantly  dwarfed  by  other  disciplines  in  higher  education,  both  in  terms  of  student  enrolment  and  faculty  and  staff”  (p  124).    Therefore  parents  from  diverse  backgrounds  must  find  alternate spaces that provide a supportive environment for their children.   The Reggio Emelia “approach to education is committed to the creation of conditions for learning that  will enhance and facilitate children's construction of his or her own powers of thinking through the synthesis of  all  the  expressive,  communicative  and  cognitive  languages  [modes]”  (Loh,  2006,  p.  4).  Environment  plays  a  crucial  role  in  skills  enhancement.  Children  need  a  conducive  and  nurturing  environment  for  emotional  and  intellectual growth. The Reggio Emelia approach also emphasizes the “environment as the third teacher” (Tarr,  2004, p. 2). Also, Luria (1928) reiterates that environment is the key factor in the development process. Socio-  cultural interactions, in absence of school support, provide diverse students with an excellent platform to acquire  valuable skills.   Emergent  curriculum,  where  children  are  offered  appropriate  classes  by  creating  a  learning  environment  deepens  their  curiosity  (Orellana,  2009).  This  curiosity  allows  them  to  engage  in  meaningful  activities that they engage in as part of their culture, and lessons learned as children will stay with them as adults  (Malaguzzi,  2009).  Gardner  (2008)  confirmed  such  prolonged  learning  “…[Reggio  Emilia  Approach]  is  effective and humane; its students undergo a sustained apprenticeship in humanity, one that may last for lifetime  (p. XV). Lifetime learning may be crucial for children growing up outside of their parents‟ country of origin.  In addition, the learning environment established at dance and music classes are conducive for skills  enhancement and cognitive advancement. Although knowledge is cognitive, it is also acquired through socio- cultural interaction (Bandura, 1998). Further, the socio-cultural instruction and self-authorship are crucial in  learning Asian Indian dance style. So parents have to make a conscious effort to take their children growing up  in the USA to Asian Indian music and dance performances periodically so the children can learn through social  pedagogies.    The following section describes the various studies and scholarly articles on dance education including   flamenco and ballet.    V.   Literature Review   Articles Selection Process: There is research in the area of dance education for the values and benefits it offers  to participants at various stages in life. Literature focuses on the cultural, religious, and performance aspects of  Bharatanatyam.  However,  there  has  not  been  any  significant  data  driven  studies  in  the  area  of  transnational  literacy  throughBharatanatyam,  a  South  Indian  classical  dance  style  because  it  is  practiced  by  a  minority  and  marginalized ethnic group of people. Bharatanatyam is not addressed in school curricula in the US. After careful  examination  of  literature  in  the  area  of  Bharatnatyam  for  almost  two  years,  I  realized  that  there  were  no  data  driven studies in the area of my interest. Hence, I explored the topic using several accredited search engines. A  few  sites  I  went  to  are  Google  Scholar,  EBSCO  HOST,  Academic  Search  Premier,  Science  Direct,  Academic  Search Elite, Nexus-Lexis,  Academic Publications, ejournal, Anthropological Literature  (Harvard  maintained),  Arts  and  Humanities  Citation  Index  (Cornell  maintained),  ATLA  Religion  Data  base  (through  the  UTSA),  FOREST (Internet East Asian Library), and JURN: Arts and Humanities. To further my confirmation of lack of  data driven studies on Bharatanatyam, I made an appointment with the sociology librarian at the UTSA library.  He confirmed that the area was not explored because it was not addressed in dance instruction at schools in the  US. To check this lapse in literature, I searched for studies using the concept cues as listed in the following table.     Concept 1  Performing arts   Dance  Bharatantayam  Performance pedagogy  (as related to performing  arts in education      Concept 2  Communication skills   Table 1: Concept Cues  Concept 3  Socio cultural   Concept 4  Asian Indians   Social aspects  Social interaction  Transnational literacy   Children   Sociology of education  Transnational interpreter  Transnational literacy  Cultural Capital  Community Cultural  Wealth  Funds of Knowledge   School curriculum  Dance education   www.iosrjournals.org                                                    53 | Page    Bharatanatyam and Transnational Literacy Through Socio-Cultural Pedagogy   I located a few data driven articles and position papers, but they were all to do with other dance forms  and not Bharatanatyam. However, many Asian Indians including my own children practice this art form, and it  is  my  obligation  to  study  my  community  and  probably  propose  a  curriculum  for  the  Bharatanatyam  dance  schools in the USA. I strongly feel that Asian Indian culture is marginalized in US schools; therefore, I chose to  research on Bharatanatyam. It is also practiced in the Asian Indian communities and is learned using the socio- cultural tenet and transnational literacy. Graham (2011), affirms:   Dance  education  programs  can  facilitate  literacy…these  dance  forms  hold  a  body  of  knowledge, history of a people and deep understandings of the world view and philosophies of  cultures creating the dance forms…[these] views are supported by the socio-cultural learning  theory of Vygotsksy (1978) and socio-ecological theory of Bronfenbrenner (1997) (p. 4).    I see the value in learning this dance myself and since it is not recognized outside the Asian Indian community, I  explored and conducted a qualitative study at three different dance schools in a  major city in the Southwest. I  studied  two  topics  -  skills  enhancement  through  Bharatanatyam  and  teacher  practices.  One  of  the  teachers  confirmed  my  finding  about  the  lack  of  data  driven  studies  in  Bharatantyam  and  she  was  willing  to  explore  research findings  for her own professional development because  she teachers the dance  (see appendix  A  for a  questionnaire).   Next, I surveyed several position papers and recorded the salient points.   Position  Papers:  The  absence  of  studies  about  Bharatanatyam  and  the  lack  of  focus  on  transnational  literacy  through  Bharatanatyam  forced  me  to  examine  a  few  position  papers  on  dance  education.  I  wanted  to  look  at  qualitative,  quantitative,  and  mixed  methods  studies  so  I  could  crosscheck  my  findings  about  how  studies  on  dance education deal with kinesthetic aspect, the adverse effects of the dances on the body, or medical problems  associated with practicing different dance styles. Hence I looked into Flamenco and Ballet dance forms because  these styles are widely practiced and popularized in the US. Both flamenco and ballet have international roots;  flamenco  originated  in  Spain,  and  ballet  is  an  Italian  renaissance  form.  Gypsies  practiced  flamenco  like  the  temple dancers practiced Bahratanatyam. These temple dancers dedicated their lives to serving the temple (God).      I  choose  flamenco  and  ballet  because  I  am  familiar  with  them  and  I  have  attended  and  appreciated  flamenco and ballet performances. The following studies revealed to me that these studies focused on the bodily  kinesthetic  or  the  advantages/disadvantages  of  dance  to  the  „musculoskeletal  demands‟,  and  the  risk  factors  involved  in  these  dances.  I  would  have  preferred  to  stay  with  more  researched  articles  and  position  papers  because there  were no data driven  studies on Bharatanatyam. However, it is important to have comprehensive  knowledge so I could situate my topic in the field by analyzing other studies in dance education.    Conclusively,  none  of  the  studies  discussed  the  benefits  of  dance  in  terms  of  transnational  literacy,  skills  enhancement,  or  cognitive  development  acquired  through  Bharatanatyam. Consequently, I decided to analyze theory driven position papers that dealt with socio-cultural  processes  and  transnational  literacy.  So,  I  decided  to  look  at  scholarly  or  theory  based  articles  for  analysis.  I  decided to conduct comprehensive analysis of two and partial analysis of three other articles.   through  socio-cultural   instructions   Next, I examined a few data driven studies and recorded the findings.   Data Driven Studies: 1. The first data driven study was Wilson‟s (2009) qualitative study on Dance Pedagogy  Case  Studies.  A  multiple  case  studies  approach  is  beneficial  to  understanding  dance  education  because  according to Wilson (2009), “Rather than using only one approach, combining several methods provides a wider  palette to paint a broader portrait  with the data” (p. 3).  A  single approach could render tunnel vision  without  providing a peripheral view for comprehensive knowledge. The chief objective of this analysis is to collect data,  report,  evaluate,  and  provide  a  detailed  explanation  about  the  dancer‟s  understanding  of  their  bodies  in  a  particular setting.   2. The second study was on  Developing Intellectual, Social and Emotional Literacy through Dance Education  by  Graham  (2008).This  study  explored  and  evaluated  skills  enhancement  through  the  medium  of  dance.  The  author  posits  that  dance  education  has  an  ability  to  facilitate  additional  skills  development  using  incidental  learning model. As an additional finding, this study examines the different kinds of literacy students learn with  dance  education.  Literacy  is  not  only  how  to  read  and  write,  but  also  to  express  intellectually,  socially  and  emotionally.  Social  Partner  Dancing  Intervention  Program  (SPDIP)  as  a  Self-Description  Scale  11  (SDQ  11)  was used in this study.    www.iosrjournals.org                                                    54 | Page    Bharatanatyam and Transnational Literacy Through Socio-Cultural Pedagogy   Relevance: This study  was appropriate for three reasons.  First, the premise of incidental learning  must  not be  neglected  in  education  and  in  out  of  school  activities.  Now  that  the  federal  government  is  thinking  of  doing  away with the arts curriculum, it presupposes several dangers in students who have varied learning styles. What  is  to  become  of  those  students  who  rely  on  dance  education  to  experience  catharsis  for  relief  and  expression?  Secondly,  how  do  ethnographic  researchers  who  study  people  for  a  comprehensive  description  of  a  culture  conduct research without the arts? How do students learn to find a way to share their creativity without the arts  curriculum, especially if they enjoy arts?    3. The third study titled, Injuries to dancers: Prevalence, treatment, and perceptions of Causes (Bowling, 1989)  is a study involving 188 professional ballet dancers and modern dance companies in the UK. This quantitative  study focused on the injuries caused by the dance form. The dancers succumb to injuries due to the floor, leg  and knee positions, and the studio climatic conditions, and wait time if an injury occurs. The study used a self- reported questionnaire developed by members of medical panel. The panel studied the causes of injuries,  preventive measures, and treatment options. The results of this study revealed a clear bodily risk with classical  ballet, flamenco, and modern dances and these risks may apply to all/any dancer.   4. The fourth article was on Dance Education Matters: Rebuilding Postsecondary Dance Education for Twenty- First Century Relevance and Resonance. Risner (2010) looked at dance equity, dance education programs,  opportunities, and leadership. The article also compares the doctoral degrees in dance and other disciplines  along with assessing the reasons why dance related topics are declining in higher education. A few reasons for  this decrease may be traced to lack of doctoral guides, social stigma, the lack of value for dance dissertations,  and the focus on curriculum and pedagogy in dance education.    Next, I also looked at studies that dealt with skills enhancement and other benefits in dance and the   following table explains the purpose and findings of the studies (see table 3).

Parent perceptions of  four-year-old girls’  general self-esteem,  social skills, and  relationship to  participation in a dance  class - Hoque, J. (2007).  Participants were 30  parents of girls enrolled  in dance and 30 parents  of girls who were not  enrolled.  2. “Creative dance”:  Potentiality for  enhancing psychomotor,  cognitive, and social- affective functioning in  seniors and young  children.

Parents found their girls  happy in dance classes.    study Bharatanatyam  and other international  dance forms.        The  above  partially  analyzed  studies  have  a  common  theme  of  positive  effects  of  dance  on  the  body   and mind of young children. Next, I examined scholarly articles.  Scholarly  Articles:  Since  Bharatanatyam  also  integrates  three  of  Gardner‟s  intellectual  capacities  such  as  mathematical, music/rhythmic, spatial, and Bodily-Kinesthetic skills by allowing children to create artistic and  creative designs on stage using music (Loh, 2006), I researched on articles that argued for the kinesthetic aspect  and the relationship between body and the mind.   1. O‟Shea (2003) traces the historical development of Bharatnatyam in the temples of south India and  its migration to the global stage in the west. The article trace the growth of this dance form from the 1980s to the  modern  day  stage  along  with  establishing  the  importance  of  the  anthropological  importance  as  portrayed  through  this  dance  form.  Further,  the  three  forerunners  who  propagated  Bharatantayam  in  the  west  were  –  Balasaraswati, Rukmini Devi Arundale, and Krishna Iyer.  The two women were instrumental in transforming  the  regional,  national,  and  international  audiences  through  their  innovative  choreographies  and  showcases.  Bharatnatyam in the west is an adaptation of Rukmini Devi Arundale‟sKalakshetraschool of dance:   In addition, O'Shea provides a new conceptual perspective by situating the history and choreographic  practice  of  bharatanatyam,  within  both  an  areas  studies  and  transnational  framework.  She  then  proceeds  to  tell  the  story  of  the  transnationalization  of  twentieth-century  bharatanatyam  within  a  local/global framework (p. 180)   2.  The  second  article  deals  with  the  introduction  and  spread  of  Bharatanatyam  in  the  west  and  how  Bharatanatyam  dancer  becomes  a  transnational  interpreter  of  the  oriental  tradition.  The  following  flyer  is  an  example of dance programs in the US.   Figure 3: India Fine Arts Program      The data driven studies by Wilson (2009) and Graham (2008) are case studies and ethnographic studies  respectively. Wilson (2009) focused his research on the physical aspects of ballet movements while working on  the  grounded  theory  approach.  Graham‟s  (2008)  concerns  were  to  study  and  explore  skills  and  literacy  enhancement  through  dance.  The  common  theme  in  these  two  studies  is  the  empirical  experiences  of  dancers  and not incidental learning and skills enhancement through dance education.Hoque (2007), Rossberg-Gempton  (1994),  Rossberg-Gempton  (1998),  and  Bowling  (1989)  discuss  parent‟s  perception  of  self-esteem  and  social  skills  enhancement  in  girls,  the  role  of  creative  dance  in  physical,  cognitive,  and  socio-affective  functioning  through dance. They also focus on the significance of dance in promoting the well-being and artistic growth in  children,  and  the  risks  involved  in  ballet,  flamenco  and  modern  dances.  The  common  theme  in  these  three  articles is the body in relation to dance. The following tables list studies and themes.      www.iosrjournals.org                                                    56 | Page    Bharatanatyam and Transnational Literacy Through Socio-Cultural Pedagogy   Hoque (2007) -  Self-esteem and  social skills    Table 2: Studies and Themes   Rosseberg-Gempton  (1994)- Creative dance  in physical, cognitive,  and socio-affective  functioning   Rossberg- Gempton (1998)  – Dance and well  being and artistic  growth   Bowling (1989)  – Risks involved  in dances      Theme   Body and  dances      A small selection of data driven studies that I partially analyzed for this study yielded common themes  found in the comprehensive analysis of Wilson (2008) and Graham (2009) studies. I decided to partially analyze  the following studies; these three studies deal with positive outcomes of dance education.    Hoque (2007) –  Dance and self  esteem, social  skills and parents  perception  enhancement   Rossberg – Gempton  (1994) – Dance and  Creativity, skills, gait,  emotions, and expression  improvement    Theme   Beneficial    Rossberg –  Gempton (1998)  – Dance and  self-perceptions,  social and motor  skills  improvement   The third set of articles chosen for this project discusses the sociological, psychological, socio-cultural ,  and  transnational  literacy  in  dance.  Steiner  and  Mann  (2009)  support  Vygotskian  socio-cultural  premise  of  „social  and  individual  processes  in  the  co-construction  of  knowledge‟,  while  Reggio-Emelia  approach  focuses  on  the  environment,  a  non-curricular  aspect,  for  developmental  processes.  Arievitch  (2003)  shares  the  accomplishments  on  Galperin‟s  „socially  constructed  shared  activities‟.  O‟Shea‟s  (2003)  preoccupation  is  dancer as a transnational interpreter.    VI.   Limitations and Conclusion   The  preliminary  analyses  of  data  driven  studies  and  various  position/scholarly  articles  on  dance  education including Bharatanatyam revealed that researchers could only build on the ideologies of other experts  in dance education and their treatment of dance education. In order for me to make a claim about the cognitive  value in learning Bharatanatyam, I have to conduct extensive longitudinal study both in  the USA and in India  involving major dance schools (with both teachers and students). Once I gather extensive data and analyze it, I  can propose a curriculum to  be pilot tested in various Bharatanatyam dance schools in  a  major city in the US  first and then Bharatanatyam  curricula can be launched internationally. If  we examine the above studies  using  the  socio-cultural  lens,  we  may  be  able  to  recognize  the  need  for  the  inclusion  of  funds  of  knowledge,  community  cultural  wealth,  and  cultural  capital  of  marginalized  students  such  as  Asian  Indian  American  and  underrepresented dance forms such as Bharatanatyam. The need for dances such as Bharatanatyam for the social,  ethnic,  and  cultural  values  as  embodied  in  similar  dance  forms  is  important  for  the  minority  groups  such  as  Asian  Indian  American.  In  addition,  dances  such  as  ballet  and  flamenco  may  help  researchers  like  me  to  understand  the  values  of  dance  in  personality  development  or  the  advantages  these  dances  offer  participants,  parents, teachers, and curriculum designers.     However,  I  am  convinced  that  Asian  Indian  children  living  in  western  countries  learn  about  their  culture,  religion,  heritage,  history,  literature,  and  fine  arts  through  socio-cultural  pedagogies  including  Bharatnatyam and Carnatic  music. The lack of data driven studies in Bharatantyam instructional practices is a  major  stumbling  block  in  understanding  the  skills  learned  using  socio-cultural  instructional  pedagogies  and  transnational  literacy  tools.  In  addition,  Participants,  teachers,  performers  and  parents‟  perceptions  through  ethnographic studies on Bharatantayam are crucial to reiterate the researcher‟s claims.

Appendix A - Questionnaire   This  exit  survey  is  to  be  administered  to  all  the  participating  teachers  of  this  project  on  a  qualitative  analysis of Interdisciplinary Bharatanatyam and skills enhancement and Teacher Practices. The questions focus  on  the  teacher  practices  only  and  they  can  be  used  for  self  evaluation  of  teacher  practices  for  their  own  professional  development.  The  respective  dance  teachers  who  have  a  thorough  understanding  of  an  interdisciplinary approach to teaching will fill out the survey, and the survey will be  completed as soon as the  observation hours are over so the principle investigator can utilize the opinions in her study. This survey must  not  take  more  than  an  hour  for  completion.  This  instrument  is  used  with  the  advanced  or  arangetram  (debut)  levels only.   According  to  Dr.  Mansilla  (2008),  an  interdisciplinary  approach  to  teaching,  “Is  the  capacity  to  integrate  knowledge  and  modes  of  thinking  drawn  from  two  or  more  disciplines  to  produce  cognitive  advancement-for  example,  explaining  a  phenomenon,  solving  a  problem,  creating  a  [appealing,  creative,  and  synthesized]  product,  or  raising  a  new  question-in  ways  that  would  have  been  unlikely  through  single  disciplinary means (p. 12).   www.iosrjournals.org                                                    58 | Page    Bharatanatyam and Transnational Literacy Through Socio-Cultural Pedagogy   Please  answer  all  of  the  following  questions  to  the  best  of  your  knowledge.

What lessons do you use to help students to be able to produce beautiful and appealing dance sequences?  11.  When and how do you add new dances based on the students‟ ability to comprehend and perform?  12.  How do you involve parents and community during productions?  13.  How are you using an interdisciplinary approach to teach Bharatanatyam for students‟ engagement?  14.  Why do you use cymbals, songs, drums, and other musical instruments?  15.  Why  and  how  do  you  adopt  stories  from  the  Hindu  epics,  religious  stories,  and  cultural  artifacts  to  teach   Bharatanatyam?   16.  Why do you require your advanced or arangetram students to dance for a long period of time?  17.  Why do you require your advanced or arangetram students to dance with a group at times?  18.  Why do you require your advanced or arangetram students to dance with the teacher at times?  19.  Why and how do you test your advanced or arangetram students with entry and exit to stage, positioning,   and movement on the stage?   20.  When do you ask questions about the content and structure of the dances?  21.  How do you repeat the instructions to students for clarity?  22.  When  do  you  dance  with  your  students  and  how  many  times  do  you  both  dance  one  artifact  before  the   arangetram(debut)   23.

I will elaborate this point by  describing the global thrust of Rukmini Devi's art and education movement, which  could not be recuperated within the territorializing intellectual framework of Indian  nationalism, and explain why she, in fact, manifests herself as a discursive failure in  standard scholarly accounts of Bharatanatyam in the United States.   Part I   Bharatanatyam manifests itself as a world form today, quite like Ballet, albeit with a  different genealogy. It is researched in western academic institutions in the United  Kingdom, Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, as well as in India, Sri Lanka,  Singapore, and Malaysia. Practitioners and dance scholars organize international con  ferences focused on Bharatanatyam all over the world today, and the Dance Studies  Program at Roehampton, supported by a grant from the Arts and Humanities Re  search Board (AHRB), has assumed a leadership role in providing a new, global profile  for the dance.1   But the globality of Bharatanatyam, intricately linked with the global discourses of  colonial modernity is still, in my opinion, not on the research and curricular agendas of  dance departments in the United States. This initiative was deferred because the small   Avanthi Meduri is Reader in the Dance  Studies Programme at Roehampton Univer  sity, London, and Convener of the new  MA/PGDip in South Asian Dance Studies.  She received her Ph.D. from the Department  of Performance Studies, New York University  and held visiting teaching appointments at  UCLA (I993-I996) and in the Department of   Performance Studies, Northwestern University  (I997-2000). Trained since childhood in  Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi, Meduri works  in the field of dance education, women's the  atre and performance. She is a Ford Scholar  and the Academic and Artistic Director of the  newly founded Centre for Contemporary Cul  ture, New Delhi.

Both modernities, however, defined the history and  identity of Bharatanatyam since the nineteenth century, continuing into the present.   When we began our investigations into the history of the dance in the United  States in the I98os, we were alerted to the presence of the two modernities and their  different realization within the framework of British colonialism in the nineteenth cen  tury, and Indian nationalism in the twentieth century.2 To mark the differences be  tween the two modernities, we theorized nineteenth-century colonial modernity as  representing a spatial, disruptive, and alien modernity, unsympathetic to local issues in  volved in the cultural production of the arts. We contrasted this alien rationality with  the "enlightened" intervention of Indian nationalists, known as "revivalists" who re  butted colonial modernity and enabled the local revival of Indian performing arts in the  twentieth century.   In my doctoral thesis, I described how colonial modernity displaced and hybridized  the life and artistic practices of hereditary women practitioners known as devadasis  (temple dancers), who sang and danced in the courts and temples of South India in the  nineteenth century. I focused attention on the translational practices of British colo  nialism and Orientalism and described how these hegemonic practices hybridized the  vernacular identity and artistic practices of devadasi women by misnaming them as  "temple prostitutes" and "nuns." Both the devadasi, and her dance known as Sadir,  were thus transnationalized during the period of British rule in India in the nineteenth  century.3   Yet when we researched the twentieth-century revival of Bharatanatyam, we took  our cue from the pioneering research of Amrit Srinivasan (I983; I985), and described it  not from within the global modernity perspective of colonialism but from within the  ideological framework of Indian nationalism and a "local" modernities perspective. We  focused attention on Rukmini Devi, a pioneer in the twentieth century revival of Bhar  tanatyam, and examined her work selectively from within the local temporality of In  dian nationalism and hailed her as Indian nationalist. But Rukmini Devi was not just a  "nationalist," but also a global Theosophist who worked on behalf of the transnational  worldview of the Theosophical Society through her long and distinguished career be  tween I920-I986. The local framework of Indian nationalism, in which we recuperated  the work of Rukmini Devi, in other words, provincialized and localized the transna  tional work and vision of Rukmini Devi.   In my own doctoral study, I sketched the story of Rukmini Devi's intercultural mar  riage to Englishman George Sydney Arundale in I920, described how Theosophist  Annie Besant, who served as second President of the Theosophical Society, groomed  Rukmini Devi to be her spiritual daughter and announced her as the leader of the  World Mother movement, conceived as a parallel movement to the World Teacher  movement in the I920S.4 Yet I did not examine, with any great detail, Rukmini Devi's  grooming within the Theosophical Society between I920-1933, her ambivalent incorpo   12 Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    ration into the Society after the demise of Annie Besant in I933, nor her final expulsion  from the Society after the demise of George Arundale in I950. I bracketed her work as  global Theosophist because I was more interested in her as Indian "nationalist" and the  unique manner in which she institutionalized Bharatanatyam in her world-renowned  institution known as Kalakshetra, followed by the second institutionalization of the arts  sponsored by the Indian nation-state in the I950S.5 As noted by the authors of Localiz  ing Knowledge in a Globalizing World, "a great deal of postcolonial theory emerges from  a close familiarity with particular regions and is committed to interdisciplinary, contex  tually grounded work" (2003, 8).   What needs to be emphasized, however, is that Rukmini Devi exceeded the de   nominational category of the "nationalist" and continued to work on behalf of the  transnational worldview of the Theosophical Society, even after the historic break with  the Society. She served as the head of the Theosophical center in Huizen, contested  elections for the Presidency of the Theosophical Society not once, but thrice, and was  repudiated on all three occasions. Despite these rebuffs, Rukmini Devi never stopped  thinking of herself as a Theosophist, endeavoring until the very end of her life to up  hold the legacies of the Theosophical Society bequeathed to her by Annie Besant and  George Arundale. One year before her death in I986, Rukmini Devi narrated her life  story into a taperecorder, (there is no biography on Rukmini Devi), likened herself to  Annie Besant, her spiritual mother, spoke of the I950S disassociation and said:   These forty years, since Arundale died in I945, have been a time of great struggle  and stress. If I did not have the inner conviction that both he and Dr. Besant were  there in spirit to protect the work, I do not think I could have carried on. The  emphasis on my own life changed from the personal to the impersonal in the I950.  Some people, while interpreting Ramayana, have said that Sita who was abducted  by Ravana and later entered the fire was only a Maya Sita and not the real Sita.  This is how I feel about myself. I had to somehow carry on because they had be  lieved in my work and the best way I could prove my love for them was to make a  success of it. There were so many personal attacks on me, hurtful gossip, many  unpleasant things. It was my karma I guess.... Dr. Besant used to say, when  she was attacked during her last days-that she could count the number of true  friends on the fingers of one hand. That was how it was. I understand now how  true it is. (2003, 6S)   If we began our studies in South Asian dance history by examining the macro and spa  tial processes of colonial modernity in the nineteenth century, our analytic frame  shrunk to detail the local dance revival of the twentieth century, and focused restric  tively on critiques of Indian nationalism, rather than on the large issues of comparative  modernities including sociological studies of state, patriarchy, and national/global in  stitutions of patronage in which Bharatanatyam circulates even today.6 I will now re  sketch Rukmini Devi's well-known story by repositioning it within the double frame  work of global and Indian modernity, simultaneously.

She married George Syd  ney Arundale, was made President of the All India Federation of Young Theosophists  and World Federation of Young Theosophists, and traveled the world in the first thir  teen years of her grooming within the Society between I92o-I933.7 On one of her inter  cultural travels around the world she met Anna Pavlova, and learned Ballet from Cleo  Nordi, a member of Anna Pavlova's troupe.8   But Rukmini Devi returned to India in I933, learned Sadir from traditional male   teachers and devadasis, renamed the dance as Bharatanatyam, and performed it on the  occasion of the Diamond Jubilee Celebrations of the Theosophical Society, in I935. On  this occasion, she used stage lighting, imported from British stagecraft, and recos  tumed, restaged, and theatricalized the dance in the manner of Isadora Duncan. If the  model international classical dance tradition for Rukmini Devi was Ballet, the model  Indian classical dance tradition was the Tanjore court style of dance that she learned  from the great guru Meenkshi Sundaram Pillai (Ramnarayan I984, 29; Sarada I996,  20).9 All through her life, Rukmini Devi juxtaposed Bharatnatyam and Ballet, develop  ing an aesthetic for Kalakshetra Bharatanatya that could be transmitted as India's own  classical dance tradition.   One year after her debut Rukmini Devi founded the International Academy of   Arts, (later renamed as Kalakshetra) to enable the revival of Bharatanatyam. She yoked  the art revivial with the educational goals of the Besant Memorial School that she es  tablished in I934.10 In the first stage of the revival between I930-I940, Rukmini Devi  founded three other institutions including the Crafts and Weaving Centre, Dr. U.V.  Swaminatha Iyer (Tamil) Library; and the Arundale Montessori Teachers Training  College."' All five institutions were housed in different wings of the huge estate prop  erty of the Theosophical Society in Adyar. Rukrnini Devi worked within the domain of  her five institutions and developed a pioneering, art and education movement that was  both "local" and transnational simultaneously.   To realize her art and education vision, Rukmini Devi invited international educa   tors and traditional dance and music teachers to teach in the different institutions. She  collaborated with both and developed a multicultural and cosmopolitan world for Bha  ratanatyam that exceeded standard anthropological definitions of the local and "na  tional" as early as the I940S.12   Anthony King has explained that "[t]he first substantial encounter between Europe  and non-Europe, between capitalist, and pre-capitalist, between white and non-white  peoples took place in what were to become the colonies, not the metropole. These en  counters were constructed under the very specific conditions of colonialism and were  largely products of the specific social and spatial conditions of colonial cities" (I997, 8).  Rukmini Devi worked within the worldview of colonialism and developed what Mike  Featherstone describes as a "Third Culture," that facilitated transcultural communica  tion (I990, 9). In I945, she conceptualized a World Culture vision for Bharatanatyam   14 Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    that Dr. Besant had commissioned her to realize for the Theosophical Society in  I925 13   But Rukmini Devi's expanding vision was suddenly arrested, reversed, and dis  placed by the promulgation of what came to be known as the Theosophical Society's  Policy of Disassociation in I950. Without going into details about the policy, the Dis  association explained why Rukmini Devi's artwork could not be accommodated within  the larger intellectual conceptualization of the Society.'4 The policy stipulated that  Rukmini Devi remove her five institutions from the grounds of the Society.   Undaunted by the crisis, Rukmini Devi  purchased a hundred acres of land in Tiru  vanmaiyu, adjoining the Adyar estate of the  Theosophical Society, and re-housed her  five institutions in this new locality in the  I960s. But she refused the Disassociation by  subversively constituting another conceptual l  framework which she called the Besant Cul  tural Centre, and incorporated her five in  stitutions into this new umbrella forma  tion.15 It took Rukmini Devi thirteen years  to move her centres and re-house them in  the second estate.

Students from all regions of India, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, Malaysia,  Singapore, and Indonesia came to study in Rukmini Devi's Kalakshetra in the I950S.  They were joined by international students from Europe, Australia, America, and En  gland. Completing their education, hundreds of Kalakshetra students, turned into  qualified teachers, returned to their respective homes, dispersing themselves in the In  dian, Asian, and western worlds to which they belonged. Kalakshetra students are thus  scattered across the world today, teaching and performing Kalakshetra Bharatanatyam  in schools, colleges, universities, and private training academies located in South Asia,  Asia, Europe, England, America, and Australia.   Dance scholars have described Kalakshetra variously as a regional, a local, a tra   ditional, and a national institution. Yet Kalakshetra exceeds or falls short of all these  definitions, premised on notions of bounded territory, because of its historical associa  tion with the syncretic, transnational vision of the Theosophical Society. I propose that   Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004) 15  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    we rethink Rukmini Devi's Kalakshetra as a translocal, contemporary arts institution in  which Rukmini Devi articulated a transnational history for Bharatanatyam connected  to Europe, England, the United States, Canada, Australia, Sri Lanka, Tibet, Singa  pore, Malaysia, and Indonesia simultaneously. The notion of the translocal "speaks to  the challenge of providing an analysis of a global system of social relations without  overgeneralizing or establishing hierarchies in which some sites are more global or  more important than others. Translocal analysis understands the links between differ  ent locations to be unpredictable and contingent rather than representative of a single  transnational condition or national identity" (Cvetkrovich and Keilner I997, 25).   I find this notion of the translocal to be useful as it enables us to examine cultural  production not just in terms of the national political struggle but in individual terms  and what it means for people like Rukmini Devi to live globally from multiple local  contexts. "Like the transnational, the translocal contests the usefulness of the nation  as a category of analysis. But it goes still further and announces the need to problema  tize the locations, spaces, and geographies within which politics and culture intersect"  (Cvetkrovich and Kellner I997, 25).   To properly historicize Rukmini Devi's work and vision, we needed to position it   firmly within the global modernity framework of the Theosophical Society in which  she worked, and within the translocal institutional context of her Kalakshetra institu  tion. We ought to have begun our interrogation by resisting the temptation to fix her  identity as an Indian nationalist or upper-caste Brahmin woman and addressed the  complexity of her position as a hyphenated Indian, specifically, an Indian-woman  Theosophist. To put it differently, we needed to develop an antiessentalist theory of  identity to research the formidable cultural and aesthetic legacy of Rukmini Devi scat  tered in the global world today. Unfortunately, we were unable to do this in the first  stage of the development of postcolonial dance studies because of the uneasy alliances  forged between transnational and area studies perspectives.17   Our failure to comprehend the work and vision of Rukmini Devi in its translocal  scope and dimensionality represents one of the most important political questions on  the agenda of dance studies scholarship and is central to what I have described above as  the failed promise of postcolonial research on Bharatanatyam. Rukmini Devi, in other  words, manifests herself as a discursive failure in standard accounts of Bharatanatyam,  as these narratives tell her story from the selective perspective of Indian nationalism.   Part 11: Bharatanatyam as a Global Dance   It was after completing my doctoral dissertation in I996, and during my teaching ap  pointment in the Department of Performance Studies at Northwestern University that  I was challenged to think specifically about the globality of Bharatanatyam as itself "a  condition of modernization and more specifically divergent modernization" (Robertson  I995, 3-4).   Since I was hired as a performance studies specialist rather than a dance scholar I  had to incorporate my eight years of postcolonial and area studies research on Bharata   i6 Dance Research journal 36/2 (WVinter 2004)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    natyam (Meduri I988; I996) within the larger framework of the six interdisciplinary  courses that I developed for the Department. Consequently, in my three years at NU, I  explored Bharatanatyam with my students in multiple contexts: Interculturalism, Asian  Diasporas, Modern and Postmodern Theories of Performance, Global Flows, Post  colonial Theory, and Third World Nationalisms."8   Even as I was engaged in developing a global modernities paradigm to discuss the   history of Bharatanatyam, I read two articles by the American scholars Matthew Allen  (I997) and Janet O'Shea (I998) that, in my judgment, localized the translocal history of  the revival by casting it uproblematically within the local framework of Indian national  ism and in the oppositional framework of tradition/modernity. Speaking confidently as  insiders to the Balasaraswati style of dance and music, (which they learned from Bala  saraswati and her family of students living in the United States and in India), both  scholars prioritize Balasaraswati's standpoint by inscribing her within an unbroken lin  eage of devadasi practitioners, going back to the nineteenth century. They contrast her  with Rukmini Devi, who came to Bharatanatyam through the intercultural trajectory of  Ballet.   Numerous scholars have critiqued the tradition/modernity model of social change  because it "replicates to some extent the presuppositions of Orientalism" (Niranjana,  Sudir, Dhareshwar I993, 5). Others like Gyan Prakash have described how Indian na  tionalist historiography and South Asia area studies programs in the United States de  ployed the tradition/change concepts to constitute new intellectual fields of enquiry in  the I920S and i9Sos. By invoking and using contested historical categories, which repli  cated Orientalist assumptions of India, Allen and O'Shea return dance scholarship to  the Orientalist/nationalist paradigm that postcolonial and postnationalist historians  have been writing against since the I980s.   I mark this new scholarship as representing the second moment in the development   of South Asian dance studies because while the earlier critiques were focused on recov  ering the repressed history of devadasi women, the new scholarship narrowed the his  torical investigation by essentializing the postcolonial identity of Balasaraswati and de  scribing her aesthetic vision comparatively with that of Rukmini Devi. While the  narrowed focus on two brown women sensationalized the story of the dance revival and  made it accessible to audiences in the United States, the analytic frame was historically  flawed because Rukmini Devi was neither in conflict nor conversation with T. Bala  saraswati.19 Both women, besides, worked in different institutional contexts both in In  dia and abroad, a point I will elaborate presently.   I could not envision the force of this new scholarship, and how it would politicize  the historical story of the dance revival, when Allen, an ethnomusciologist by training,  visited me in California in I996, requesting a copy of my dissertation in order to write  an article on aspects of the revival from the point of view of the traditional community  of devadasi practitioners. The article in its published form was more general in its fo  cus. It endeavored to "Rewrite the Script for South Indian Dance," by focusing atten  tion on a single moment in the history of the Kalakshetra institution when Rukmini  Devi separated from her male dance teacher and his family in I943.   Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004) 17  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    One has onily to contrast the "tenor of outrage" in which Allen presents his point  of view by juxtaposing it with Rukmini Devi's own understated narration of the events.  In her narration of the event she explains how "she was deserted [italics mine] by my  teachers, including, I am sorry to say my own first teacher Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai"  (Ramani 2003, 56). While Allen argues that Rukmini Devi forced traditional teachers  to leave her institution, Rukrnini Devi describes herself as being abandoned. Which  standpoint should we privilege today? 20   Tradition/Change as Problematic Postcolonial Concepts   My purpose here is not to refute Allen's claims, but to call attention to the tradition/  change analytic framework that I believe he uses uncritically in his essay. For one thing,  Allen conflates the differential gender issues that pressed upon devadasi women in the  I940S with those of the male teachers and presents both in a universal frame of "the  traditional community." In my dissertation, I described the I940S second phase of the  revival as representing a "bitter-sweet transition" by pointing to the emergence of a  broader middle-class, separate from Rukmini Devi. I showed how this class, working  outside the institutional domain of Kalakshetra, wooed male teachers in the I940s, and  helped create new, aesthetic patriarchies in the dance practice.   If Rukmini Devi had created a patrilineal history for Bharatanatyam bypassing de   vadasi traditions and prioritizing male dance teachers, in what I described as the first  stage of the revival in the I930S, she reversed that priority, in the second stage of the  I940S, by inviting devadasi women to teach in her institution. Yet the middle class that  emerged outside her institution supplemented and supplanted devadasi practitioners by  privileging male teachers over devadasis in the I940s. Because Allen conflates devadasi  issues with those of the male teachers, he fails to read the internal dynamic of appropri  ation between male teacher and devadasi, which also fed into the hegemonic forces that  marginalized these women practitioners in the I940s.   BaLasaraswati and Rukmini Devi in a Binary Frame   Allen's essay was followed by O'Shea's article published in I998. O'Shea narrowed her  analytic frame of tradition/change to focus on the aesthetic legacies of "two towering  women that stand at the source [my italics] of twentieth century Bharatanatyam: Tan  jore Balasaraswati and Rukmini Devi" (I998, 46). She then compares the "instructional  and interpretive communities" of the two dancers, "their discrete sets of aesthetic stan  dards and choreographic conventions (57) by arguing that Balasaraswati was affiliated  with a school known as the Tanjore court style while Rukmini Devi was associated  with a style that she developed at her Kalakshetra school" (46). O'Shea's binary is his  torically flawed because Rukmini Devi also revived the Tanjore court style of dance in  her Kalakshetra institution in the I930S, but refined and aestheticized the court style to  articulate a neoclassical, Tanjore court-style Bharatanatyam in I943.   Whereas almost all of the seven odd sets of binaries that O'Shea invokes to develop   18 Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    her comparative critique can be refuted, I prefer to focus on the problems inherent  in the binary model itself, an analytic frame that has been subjected to rigorous critique  in postmodern, poststructuralist, and feminist discourses and bracketed because of the  essentialisms it replicates. In her doctoral dissertation (2ooI) O'Shea again discusses the  two women within the binary framework "of Brahmin Rukmini Devi and devadasi  Tanjore Balasaraswati respectively ... so that tensions between the two concerns man  ifests as a debate between a reformer and traditionalist" (2001, 24). It is this placement  of the term "Brahmin" before Rukmini Devi and "devadasi" before Balasaraswati, that I  want to critique now because O'Shea uses the prefix to mark originary caste and class  differences between the two women.   Balasaraswati and Rukmini Devi As Inside-Outsiders   Let me begin by saying that Tanjore Balasaraswati was not a "traditional" devadasi. Al  though she had her Arangetram (debut performance) at the Amanakshi Amman temple  in Kancheepuram, she was never a dedicated temple dancer married by a priest to the  god.2" She hailed from a family who had served in the court of Tanjavur, but colonial  modernization had impacted the family of musicians and dancers to such an extent that  they relocated to the Madras Presidency towards the end of the nineteenth century.22  "Neither the mother nor grandmother of T. Balasaraswati performed dance, though  their female ancestors had been court dancers at Tanjavur. Leaving behind the practice of  the dance, the women in this family began to concentrate in the late nineteenth century  on vocal or instrumental music" (Allen I997, 68). T. Balasaraswati's mother and grand  mother thus intended for Balasaraswati to be a musician rather than a dancer.   It is true that Balasaraswati was fiercely proud of her mother, her grandmother, her   devadasi ancestors and their artistic achievements (O'Shea I998, 48), but she was really  an inside-outsider to the devadasi traditions because she had not been dedicated to the  temple or married to the god. We thus ought not describe her as a centered subject lo  cated fully within the social practice of devadasis, but rather as one whose identity was  under erasure and discontinuous with her ancestral and familial lineage. Balasaraswati,  in other words, was neither a true devadasi, nor was she not a devadasi.   Similarly, Rukmini Devi described herself as a traditional dancer because she   worked on behalf of the twentieth-century revival of traditional Indian dance. But she too,  like Balasaraswati, was not an insider to devadasi traditions because she was a Brahmin  woman. Yet Rukrnini Devi was not a "true Brahmin." She too was discontinuous with  her own ancestral and familial history because she was married to an Englishman,  George Sydney Arundale, who was also a Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church. Like  Balasaraswati, Rukmini Devi's identity was under erasure because she was neither a true  Brahmin nor was she not a Brahmin.   The contingency of the double negative-being neither inside nor entirely outside  their own respective familial histories-defined the lives of the two women, canceled  and put under erasure, their unitary identities. Yet it is this cancellation, paradoxically,  that permits us to continue to read them in the place of the prefix, whether it be the   Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004) 19  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    devadasi or Brahmin woman, which they could never fully inhabit in their lives. Citing  Derrida, Stuart Hall has described this approach as thinking at the limit, as thinking in  the interval, a sort of double writing. I propose it as another antiessentialist way in  which we might think the complex processes of subject formation that fractured and  defined the identities of T. Balasaraswati and Rukmini Devi respectively. It is worth  repeating that "what this decentering requires is not the abandonment or abolition of  the subject but a reconceptualization-thinking it in its new displaced or decentered  position within the paradigm" (Hall I996, 2).   Heterogenizing "Tradition"   Because both women hailed from different class and caste backgrounds, they used the  resources of their own history, language, and culture selectively to invent different tra  ditions for Bharatanatyam. Yet they both emerged as historical subjects within a shared  but unevenly accented frame of Indian modernism in the I930S. While Balasaraswati  was presented by V. Raghavan and other scholars as a traditional dancer on the plat  form of the Madras Music Academy in I933, Rukmini Devi was also presented as a  traditional dancer by her husband George Sydney Arundale in her debut performed in  the Adyar theatre, located within the huge estate of the Theosophical Society. Both  women performed an old dance known as Sadir under the new name of Bhartanatyam,  given to the dance by scholars like V. Raghavan and worked as "traditional dancers"  within the modern framework of Indian nationalism over the fifty-year period of the  revival between I93o0Ig8o.23   If Balasaraswati worked within the institutional patronage provided by the Madras  Music Academy, hailed as a premier national institution, Rukmini Devi worked within  the transnational system of patronage provided by the Theosophical Society. While  Rukmini Devi taught in her Kalakshetra institution, located on the grounds of the  Theosophical Society, and traveled to Europe and America to discharge her responsi  bilities as the President of the Theosophical Society in Huizen, Balasaraswati worked  intermittently within the institutional framework of the Madras Music Academy, trav  eled to the United States, lived there for short and long periods of time, and offered  residencies within the institutional framework of Dance and Ethnomusicology pro  grams in the I960s (see Pattabhiraman and Ramachandran i984a; Meduri i996a; Allen  I997). The two women, in other words, were traveling women who lived and worked in  different institutional locations within India and abroad, and their career trajectories  overlapped only occasionally.   To undertake a critical, comparative examination of the two women's artistic lega   cies, we must not falsely hierarchize the analytic frame, and exceptionalize T. Bala  saraswati in relation to Rukmini Devi. We need to place both in a coeval temporality,  that is the frame of Indian modernism, position them as inside-outsiders within it, and  describe them as in fact representing two similar but different "iterations of Bharat  anatyam" in the I930s. We need to equalize the discursive terrain, precisely because   20 Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    identities are constructed within, not outside discourse, and so that we might "under  stand identities as produced in specific historical and institutional sites, within specific  discursive formations and practices, by specific enunciative strategies" (Hall I996, 4).   Enunciative Strategies   If Balasaraswati drew on the rich musical legacy of her family to provide a distinguish  ing place for herself in the revival, Rukmini Devi foregrounded the musical traditions  of the galaxy of traditional male teachers that she gathered in her institution and gave  herself a new, enunciative position in the revival. Both women enlarged their individual  identities by shouldering the weight of a larger collectivity, which they hailed variously  as tradition, ancestry, and historical legacy. Why did the two women carry this weight  of history on their backs? Why could they not shrug it off and speak freely as modern  American dancers did in Europe and America of the I930s?   Neither Allen nor O'Shea theorize this burden of the reinvented past that the two  women carried on their backs, a burden emerging not from the stable core of the self,  but from the contingency of the institutional and political context of Indian national  ism and international Orientalism in which they were speaking, writing, and dancing.  Both writers simply essentialize the identities of the two women by assuming a foun  dational theory of identity for them premised on unitary theories of caste and class,  and articulate them as knowing subjects working within a theory of intentionality.  Gyan Prakash explains that "the foundational view of identity assumes that history is  ultimately founded in and represented through some identity-individual, class, or  structure-which resists further decomposition into heterogeneity" (I990, 393). Both  Allen and O'Shea develop this foundational theory of identity by unreflexively posi  tioning Balasaraswati and Rukmini Devi within the tradition/change binary.   Again, my main concern here is not to dispute O'Shea or Allen's misrepresenta  tions, but to point to the inadequacies in the tradition/change model of social change  that they deploy. At the moment of the revival in the I930s, the Sadir dance tradition  was, in fact, represented by three different sets of "traditional people": male dance  teachers represented a version of the devadasi Sadir; "ritually dedicated" devadasi  women like Gowri Amma, represented their own version of Sadir; and T. Bal  asaraswati, the inside-outsider to devadasi traditions represented a version of Sadir that  she had learned from her male and female teachers.   Should we describe all three sets of "traditional practitioners" as insiders? Or were   they all really inside-outsiders because they were all representing Sadir in the new name  of Bharatanatyam and negotiating with the uneven processes of anticolonial mod  ernism in the I930s? Who possessed the authentic tradition, and what indeed was "tra  dition" and "authenticity" in the postcolonial context of the I930s?   Whether the central figure is Rukmini Devi or Balasaraswati there is, as James  Clifford points out, no politically innocent methodology for intercultural interpreta  tion. "Some strategy of localization is inevitable if significantly different ways of life are   Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004) 21  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    to be represented. But local in whose terms? How is significant difference politically ar  ticulated? Who determines where and when a community draws its lines, names its in  siders and outsiders? These are far reaching issues" (I997, I9).   The political question raised by Clifford is germane to our discussion because there   are no more than a handful of students practicing the Balasaraswati style of dance in  India (see Meduri 2005, 2I4-223). Yet Balasarawati has a sizeable number of students in  the US because she taught dance in Ethnomusicology and Dance Departments in the  United States (see Cowdery I995). In contrast, Rukmini Devi's student family is dis  persed all over India and the world. Who is the "insider" and who is the "outsider"?  Why is this question about insiders and outsiders being raised by American scholars in   the United States and not in India? Since Rukmini Devi and T. Balasaraswati are no  more, who needs identity today?   Conclusion   I have sketched the story of Rukmini Devi as a global-Indian story in this special issue  on South Asian Dance not because it is the apposite thing to do in the present intellec  tual climate when we are all worrying the questions of globalization and the arrival of the  contemporary in Indian dance practice. Rukmini Devi's global Indian story acquires a his  torical charge because we have neither described her transnational vision, nor the unique  manner in which she contemporized Bharatanatyam with adequate sophistication.24   I have outlined her global story in order to urge more general comparative studies of  Indian dance, which will trace the similarities and differences between Ballet and Ka  lakshetra Bharatanatyam. It is this double sited interactional history, one that engaged  dialogically with colonial modernity, on the one hand, and with local Indian traditions,  on the other, that needs to be placed on the research agenda of South Asian dance  scholarship in the United States.   It is true that Rukmini Devi's art and education movement fed into the hegemonic  forces that marginalized devadasi practitioners. Yet it is her art and education move  ment that also enables us today to rehistoricize and reconceptualize emergent "Third  World" dance forms and cultural negotiations not as "thin replicas of an experience we   in the west are connoisseurs of 'always already' but as one in which the Euro-American  experience is significant but neither singular nor always the exemplary center" (Ap  padurai I988, I).   Notes   1.1 am indebted to all my mentors in  the Department of Performance Studies:  Richard Schechner, my advisor, Peggy  Phelan, Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett  and Mick Taussig, for encouraging and   supporting my work in the Department of  Performance Studies, Tisch School of the  Arts, New York University. I enrolled in  the Department to study the socio-political  history of Bharatnatyam, the dance that   22 Dance Research Journal 36/2 (Winter 2004)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:48:52 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    I had learned from childhood and which I  had performed as a professional dancer  both on the national and international  stage. I desired specifically to understand  the regional, national, and transnational  history of the dance, and began to develop  a postcolonial perspective to understand the  revival and transnationalization of Bharat  anatyam (I988; I996). For accounts describ  ing the pioneering research of scholars  working at the University of Roehampton,  see Andree Grau (2002; 2004); Allesandra  Iyer (I997; 2003); and Stacey Prickett (2004).  2. Drawing on the interdisciplinary re   search of scholars like Amrit Srinivasan  (I983; I985); Fredrique Marglin (I985);  Saskia Kersenboom-Story (I987); Kay  Jordan (I989); Susie Tharu and K.Lalitha  (I993); Tejaswini Niranjana, P. Sudesh, and  Vivek Dhareshwar (I993), dance scholars  in the United States endeavored to articu  late a postcolonial research initiative for  Bharatanatyam. In the first stage of the de  velopment of South Asian dance studies  in the United States, there were very few  scholars working in the area. See Avanthi  Meduri (I988; I990; I992; I996), Uttara  Coorlawala (I992; I996), and Anne-Marie  Gaston (I992; I996).   3. See Meduri (I996, i-iio); Davesh  Soneji (i999); Jeffrey Spear and Meduri  (2004). All three essays deal specifically  with the hybridization and transnationali  zation of devadasi dance practices. Drawing  on the first part of my thesis, dealing with  devadasis, I also authored and acted in a  postcolonial play entitled God Has Changed  His Name. Premiered in India in I997, the  bilingual play was presented in twenty-four  cities across India, and staged in main  stream theatre venues, schools, and colleges  of India. A regional (Tamil) version of the  play was staged in I998. See Seagull Theatre  Quarterly (I999, 29-5I), for a discussion  about the play and issues raised in the  performance.   4. It was Amrit Srinivasan (I983, 73-99)   who first drew attention to the World  Teacher and World Mother movements  in the I98os. I elaborated on questions re  lating to Rukmini Devi's agency (I996,  277-299). Mathew Allen (I997, 70-74) also  provides a neat and elegant summary of  the two transnational movements. In  TranslocalModernities (forthcoming), I  evolve an antiessentialist theory of identity  focusing on the enunciation of the three  names: Rukmini-Devi-Arundale.   5. See Meduri (I996, 406-458) and Pal  labi Chakravorty (I998, I07-I20) for a dis  cussion pertaining to the institutionaliza  tion of the arts. See also Mathew Allen's  elegant summary of my research, embel  lished by his own innovative research into  the music revival (I997, 63-I00).   6. If Rukmini Devi was celebrated as a  pioneer and heroine who saved the dance  of Bharatanatyam before her demise in  I986, she was hailed as an "appropriator" in  Indian and United States dance scholarship  of the I990S. See Srinivasan (I983, 73-99),  and Allen (I997, 63-I00). By 2000, the  historical story of the dance revival was  staged as a struggle between two women  inscribed in two different caste and class  backgrounds: "Brahmin Rukmini Devi and  devadasi T. Balasasaraswati" (O'Shea 200I,  24). In the second part of the paper, I de  scribe the global contexts in which the two  women worked and explain why we need to  rethink the revival story of Bharatanatyam  outside the limiting framework of Indian  nationalism as such.   7. In Translocal Modernities (forthcom   ing), I discuss the grooming of Rukmini  Devi within the transnational worldview  of the Theosophical Society, and how she  replicated the Divine Dancer legacies of  Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis in  what I describe as the first stage of her  enunciation between I920-I933.   8.

See my essay (2005,195-223) on the   staging techniques that Rukmini Devi used  in 1935 and how she developed a multifac  eted, dramaturgical aesthetic for Bharat  anatyam by incorporating the staged aes  thetic into the institutional goals of her  Kalakshetra institution.   10. Rukmini Devi combined the visions   of the two centers and articulated a trans  national art and education movement  known as "Education without Fear, and  Art without Vulgarity" (Nachiappan 2001,  18). C. Nachiappan, who worked with  Rukmini Devi from 1940, until her demise  in 1986, describes the transnational art edu  cation movement in this way: "Arts were an  integral part of the school system and en  abled great experiments in education, like  introducing the Dolton system of educa  tion in which children learnt by themselves  without too much interference from teach  ers. It is here that Dr. Montessori con  ducted her first Indian Montessori course   and experimented with the advanced  Montessori Method for 6-12 year old chil  dren" (2001,18).   11. See Silver Jubilee Report o? Kalak   shetra (193 6-19 61), for a brief discussion of  the five institutions.   12. By the 1940s, Kalakshetra also be  came famous for the galaxy of traditional  teachers that Rukmini Devi gathered in  her institution (Ramani 2003). Since the  traditional teachers recruited in the insti  tution were well versed in such diverse   fields as dance, music, painting, weaving,  Sanskrit language, drama and folk arts,  Rukmini Devi urged them to teach from  within their fields of expertise and special  ization. She thus envisioned a multi  disciplinary, cosmopolitan institution of  the kind unknown in South India in the  1940s: one in which education, crafts,   music, dance, painting, and research co  existed to constitute what Kamaladevi  Chattopadyay described as a Vision of  totality" (1986, 5).   13. Dr. Besant described the world   movements at the Star Congress, Ommen,  in 1925, and again in the Golden Jubilee  Celebrations of the Theosophical Society,  held at the international headquarters in  India, 1928. See Annie Besant (1925); Ran  son (1928, 467^472) for a fuller elaboration  of Besanas World vision. But Rukmini  Devi indigenized Annie Besant's global  movements and developed what I describe  as her ACE (arts, culture and education)  movement, which was both continuous  with and different from Besant's trans  national vision. Also see Translocal Mo   dernities (forthcoming).   14. See fourth President Jinarajadasa's   official statement on the Disassociation Pol   icy in The Indian Theosophist (1950,19-23).  See also the June issue of The Indian  Theosophist, which is practically a Disassoci  ation Policy number. I discuss the Policy  and describe its impact on Rukmini Devi's  global vision in Translocal Modernities  (forthcoming).   15. See Besant Cultural News Bulletin   (1949). On the last page of each and every  Art andEducation journal that Rukmini  Devi edited and published in the 1950s is  inscribed this note: "The Besant Cultural  Trust is the name given to the group of fol  lowing institutions: Besant Theosophical  High School, Kalakshetra-College of Fine  Arts, Arundale Training Centre for Teach  ers, Hostels and Dr. Swaminath Iyer  Library.

The Government of India requested  Rukmini Devi to lead cultural delegations  to foreign countries, chair national com  mittees set up for the incorporation of art  and culture into higher education, and  honored her with numerous national   awards including the Padma Bhushan and  the Sangeet NatakAkademi in the 1950s.  She was also nominated to serve as the first   woman legislature in the upper house of  the Indian Parliament, immediately after  the constitution of the nation-state in 1950.  She completed two terms in Parliament,  moved a bill for the Prevention of Cruelty  to Animals, and received the Prani Mitra  or Animal Lover Award in 1968. The Royal  Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to  Animals, London, likewise awarded Ruk  mini Devi with the Queen Victoria Silver  Medal in 1958, and the Council of the  World Federation for the Protection of  Animals, The Hague, added her name to  their Roll of Honor in 1959. Rukmini Devi  was also nominated as candidate to serve as  President of India in 1977, but s^e refold  the nomination.   17. As a researcher who combined both  perspectives in the enunciative phase of  postcolonial dance studies in the 1980s, I  admit candidly to the many invaluable in  sights to be gained in describing Bharata  natyam exclusively from within an Indian  national or area studies perspective. The lo  cal framework enabled me to understand  why Rukmini Devi Arundale revived  Bharatanatyam from within what I have  elsewhere described as her temple stage  aesthetic and why that symbolic structure  continues to prevail in contemporary local,  global, and diasporic practices of Bharat  natyam today. See Meduri (2005,3-29) and  Translocal Modern i tes (forthcoming).   i8. In this context, I want to thank  Dwight Conquergood and Margaret  Drewal for encouraging me to teach the  above mentioned "experimental" courses  in the Department of Performance Studies  at NU.   19. In my thesis (1996), I focused my dis  cussion specifically on the historic moment  when Balasaraswati questioned Rukmini  Devi in the first national dance seminar of   1958 (1996, 406-458), and tried to think the  agency of the two women outside founda  tional theories of caste and class identity,  and beyond the category of "insiders" and  "outsiders" simultaneously.   20. In my dissertation, I identified the   1943 moment as representing a problematic  beginning in the history of the develop  ment of the Kalakshetra institution (1996,  366-405), and described it as an ambivalent  moment by pointing to the incorporation  of a devadasi by the name of Saradamabal  who began teaching in the institution at  that time. The 1943 separation from male  teachers was empowering from a gender  point of view because Rukmini Devi  evolved a new "dancer-teacher" category in  that moment of crisis. After 1943, Kalak  shetra students learned both the dance vo   cabulary and also the techniques for con  ducting dance recitals, which had been  preserved exclusively in the custody of male  dance teachers till the 1940s.   21. See Kersenboom-Story (1987) for full   explication describing the dedication rites  and rituals of devadasis, specifically their  marriage to temple-gods and the lifestyle  practices that evolve from the dedication  ritual.   22. See Kersenboom-Story's discussion  about the unraveling of devadasi traditions,  which she marks in 1856 (1987, 47). See also  my discussion about the difficulties in  marking the precise moment when the  artistic practices of devadasis were  reconfigured (1996, 27-31).

Although it is not clear who renamed  the dance, most critics attribute the renam  ing to V. Raghavan, the eminent scholar of  Sanskrit studies. See my discussion about  the new name Bharatanatyam given to the  dance in 1930s (1996, 267-276).

As part of my three-year post  doctoral research in India between  2001-2004,1 endeavored to develop a  transnational research initiative for   Bharatanatyam by using Rukmini Devi  as case study. During this time, I curated  Rukmini Devi's photo archive, which I  presented in New Delhi, Calcutta, Kuala  Lumpur, Singapore, Colombo, London,  Tokyo, and Melbourne. I also collaborated  with Professor Kathy Foley at the Univer  sity of California, Santa Cruz, and devel  oped an intercultural performance script  titled Shattering The Silence: The Three  Women of the Theosophical Society. The piece  positions Rukmini Devi within the global  discourses of the Theosophical Society and  describes her as the one who carried the   torch for the feminist legacy of the Theo  sophical Society in India. To complement  this research, I developed another perform  ance script entitled Birds of the Banyan Tree,  which dramatized how Rukmini Devi kept  the global flame alive in her life and work  in India. The play was presented as part of  the Birth Centenary Celebrations in New  Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai in March  2004. In April 2004,1 taught two courses  on the globalization of Bharatanatyam,  with a focus on Rukmini Devi, in the De  partment of Theatre Arts at Santa Cruz,  developed a short script entitled Birth of  Bharatanatyam, and staged it in collabora  tion with students in the Second Stage  Theatre at UCSC in June 2004.

Image  Processing   INTRODUCTION    Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform  image  processing  on  digital  images.  A  digital  image  is  a  numeric  representation of a two-dimensional image. The field of digital image  processing  has  experienced  continuous  and significant  expansion  in  recent years. The usefulness of this technology is apparent in many  different disciplines covering medicine through remote sensing. The  Application  of  Digital  includes  medical  applications, restorations and enhancements, digital cinema, image   transmission  and coding, pattern recognition, high-resolution display  etc. A number of real-world problems from astronomy to  consumer  imaging  find  applications  for  image  restoration  algorithms.  Plus,  image restoration is an easily visualized example of a larger class of  inverse  problems  that  arise  in  all  kinds  of  scientific,  medical,  industrial  and  theoretical  problems.  A  new  and  simple  two-level  decision    making  system  has  been  designed  for  performing  scale-,  translation-  and rotation-invariant recognition of various double hand   gestures (samyuktha) of  bhartanatyam. The orientation filter is used  at the first-level to generate a feature vector that is able to distinguish  between  several  gestures.  At  the  second-level  the  silhouette  of  the  different  gestures  is  extracted,  followed  by  the  generation  of  the  corresponding edge detection and the evaluation of the gradients at its  end  points.  These  gradients  constitute  the  second  feature  set,  for  recognizing those gestures which remain to be identified at the first- level. An application has been provided in the domain of double-hand   gestures  of  bharatanatyam.  Computer  recognition  of  hand  gestures  may  provide  a  more  natural-computer  interface,  allowing  people  to  point, or rotate a CAD model by rotating their hands. Hand gestures   can  be  classified  in  two  categories:  static  and  dynamic.  A  static  gesture is a particular hand configuration and pose, represented by a  single image. A dynamic gesture is a moving gesture, represented by  a  sequence  of  images.  We  will  focus  on  the  recognition  of  double  hand mudras.     *Corresponding author: Dr. Srimani, P. K.   Department of Computer Science and Maths, B.U, Director, R and D, B.U.          Related Work    A thorough survey of the literature pertaining to the topic of research  reveals  that  very  sparse  literature  is  available  with  regard  to  the  subject  and  no  work  is  available  with  regard  to  the  present  work.  Hence, the present investigation is carried out to throw light on the  subject. Some related works include [1] to [6]. The main objective of  the present investigation is recognition of Bharatanatyam mudras by  using  the  Image  processing  techniques.  The  codes  are  written  and  implemented through MATLAB. The work is first of its kind in the   literature.  The  scope  of  this  investigation  is  to  create  a  method  to  recognize  Samyukta  Bharatanatyam  gestures,  based  on  a  pattern  recognition technique; employing histograms of local orientation. The  orientation  histogram  will  be  used  as  a  feature  vector  for  gesture  classification and interpolation.    Background    Research on hand gestures can be classified into three categories. The  first category, glove based analysis, employs sensors (mechanical or  optical)  attached  to  a  glove  that  transducers  finger  flexions  into  electrical  signals  for  determining  the  hand  posture.  The  second  category,  vision  based  analysis, is  based  on  the  way  human  beings  perceive information about their surroundings. It is probably the most   difficult  to  implement  in  a  satisfactory  way.  The  third  category,   analysis of drawing gestures, usually involves the use of a stylus as an  input  device.  Analysis  of  drawing  gestures  can  also  lead  to  recognition of written text.    METHODOLOGY    The  present  investigation  is  carried  out  by  using  MATLAB  [7].  MATLAB  is  an  interactive  system  whose  basic  data  element  is  an  array  that  does  not  require  dimensioning.  This  allows  us  to  solve  many technical computing problems, especially those with matrix and  vector formulations. In a fraction of the time it would take to write a  program in a scalar non-interactive language such as C or Fortran.                    International Journal of Current Research, Vol. 5, Issue, 6, pp.1457-1462, June, 2013   1458    The reason for selecting the MATLAB tool[7] for the development of  this paper is its toolboxes.  Toolboxes allow you to  learn  and  apply   specialized  technology.  Toolboxes  are  comprehensive  collections  of  MATLAB functions (M-files) that extend the MATLAB environment  to solve particular classes of problems. It includes among other image   processing  and  neural  networks  toolboxes.  The  objective  of  this  research is to develop a suitable prototype for the recognition of the  24  Samyukta  Hastas  of  Bharatanatyam  in a two  dimensional space,  using image processing techniques [1]. We aim to make the computer  act  as  a  teacher  to  correct  the  dance  gestures,  for  the  purpose  of  promoting  e-learning  of  the  nuances  of  Bharatanatyam  across  the  world.    System Overview        Fig 1. Block Diagram of hand gesture recognition system     Data Set Description    The term Indian Classical Dance  comprises all the art forms of the  Natyashastra written by the ancient musicologist Sage Bharata. The  Natyashastra confers classical status to eight Indian dances, of which  Bharatanatyam  is  one  of  the  oldest.  A  popular  interpretation  of  the  name  is  BHAva  (expression)  +  RAga  (musical  mode)  +  TAla  (rhythm)  +  NATYAM  (dance)  =  BHARATANATYAM.  A  distinctive feature of Bharatanatyam Dance  is the use of expressive  hand  gestures  as  a  way  of  communication.  Hastas  [3]  refers  to  a  variety of hand symbols that a dancer can use. Hastas can be broadly  classified into  two  categories,  viz.,  Asamyukta  Hastas (Single  hand  gestures)  and  Samyukta  Hastas (Double  hand  gestures).  There  exist  28 Asamyukta Hastas and 24 Samyukta Hastas.         Fig. 2. Samyukta Bharatanatyam Mudras        Anjali:    This  mudra  is  used to  offer  salutation  to  the  God,  Elders,  Teachers and a Brahmin. The Anjali mudra is kept above the head to  offer  salutations  to  the  God.  It  is  kept  in  front  of  the  face  to  offer  respects to the Teachers and Elders. It is kept in front of the chest to  offer pranams to the twice -born or the Brahmin’s.     Karkata:  This verse says that Karkata is used to denote: Arrival of  people  (Get  together),  Showing  the  Belly  Blowing  the  counch,  Twisting and stretching of Limbs, Bending a Branch    Kapota:  The  shloka  says  that  Kapota  can  be  used  to  denote  the  following:  Respectful  salutations.  Such  a  Mudra  is  held  while  conversation  with  teachers  or  Guru.  Its  a  mark  of  acceptance  or  obedience. It shows the Vinayam (down to earth attitude) quality of  an individual.     Swastika:  The  shloka  says  that  swastika  denotes  a  Crocodile:  My  imagination says it can be used, To say “No”, To show a blocked road  or a passage, To show imprisonment    Dola: The shloka says that Dola can be used: At the commencement  of natya (Natyarambhe), It is a pose prescribed by the   experts.    Pushpaputa:  Thus  according  to  the  shloka,  Pushpaputa  is  used  to  denote  the  following:  Indicate  waving  of  lights  to  gods  (to  perform  Aarti),  Acceptance  of  water  or  any  fruits  etc,  To  show  offerings  to  Gods  Offering floral tributes at the time of Mantra puja    Utsanga:    The  shloka  says  that  Utsangha  is  used  to  denote:  An  embrace,  To  show  Modesty,  Shyness  etc,  Display  of  Armlets  and  other  such  ornaments,  Coaching  children,  The  shloka  say  that  this  Mudra  indicates a  Linga  of  lord  Shiva.  Linga  means  sign,  mark  or  symbol. Thus a Shivlinga is a symbol that represents Hindu God lord   Shiva,  Linga is derived from the Sanskrit word lingam, which comes  from li meaning, “to dissolve” and gam “to move on”. This refers to  the belief that one appears as a being in the world and then dissolves  back into the universe. A Shivalinga is phallus-shaped and fixed on a  base,  which  is  shaped  like  a  yoni.  The  structure  symbolises  the  supreme creative energy. It represents the Shivashakti ie the union of  Lord Shiva and Devi Parvati. It is usually made of stone.    Katakavardhana:  The shloka says that katakavardhana can be used  to denote: Coronation ceremony, Worship, Marriage    Karariswastika:  According to the the shloka karariswastika help to  show: Stems and branches of the trees, A huge tree, A hill top or its  peak    Shanka:  It says that the Shankha mudra is used to denote a counch,  Shankha was also blown in the battlefield as a sign to begin the war.  The  sound  of  a  Shankha  is  considered  sacred  and  is  also  blown  in  some of the Indian rituals. Shankha has a divine significance in Indian  mythology.  It  says  that  this  Mudra  denotes  a  Wheel.  In  Sanskrit  Chakra means a circle or a wheel. Very often in Dance this hasta is  used to represent Lord Vishnu’s Sudarshan chakra. He is   dipicted holding it with his right forefinger. This chakra is a Divine  weapon with sharp edges and is supposed to spin like a Disc.    Samputa:    It  says  that  Samputa  is  used to  denote:  Concealment  of  objects.  It  can  be  used  to  show    secrets  or  something  that  is  kept  safely. It can also denote something that is hidden.    Pasha:  The  shloka  says  that  the  pasha  hasta  is  used  to  denote:  Internal fights or Quarrels, A String, A Chain    Kilaka:  The shloka says that this kilaka hasta is used to  denote: A  feeling of Love and affection, Funny talks, hilarious conversation etc.     Preprocessing    Preprocessing is very much required task to be done in hand gesture  recognition  system.  We  have  taken  prima  database[1]  which  is  standard database in gesture  e recognition. We have taken total 25  signs each  sign  with  40 images.  Preprocessing  is  applied  to images  before  we  can  extract  features  from  hand  images.  Preprocessing  consist of two steps        Segmentation     Morphological filtering                     International Journal of Current Research, Vol. 5, Issue, 6, pp.1457-1462, June, 2013   1459    A.    Segmentation  is  done  to  convert  gray  scale  image  into  binary  image so that we can have only two object in image one is hand and  other  is  background.  Otsu  algorithm  [2]  is  used  for  segmentation  purpose  and  gray  scale  images  are  converted  into  binary  image  consisting  hand  or  background.  After  converting  gray  scale  image  into  binary  image  we  have  to  make  sure  that  there  is  no  noise  in  image  so  we  use  morphological  filter  technique.  Morphological  techniques consist of four operations: dilation, erosion, opening and   closing. The preprocessing of the hand gesture consists of detecting   the skin color in the image, and cropping the hand region in order to  avoid  unnecessary  details  in  the  background.  The  images  are  then  resized to 240 x 240 and converted to gray scale. The next step is  the  feature  extraction  procedure.  A  suitable  feature  vector  which  is  invariant  to  translation,  rotation,  scaling  and  reflection  needs  to  be  chosen  for  the  purpose  of  distinguishing  between  the  different  gestures.     A  major  difficulty  is  associated  with  the  rotation  and  scaling  involved.    For  example,  a  gesture  image  rotated  to  any  degree  or  scaled  to  any  level  should  represent  the  same  gesture.  Orientation  filters  [2]  have  been  used  in  various    image  processing  and  vision  tasks, by applying filters of arbitrary orientation and phase. Typically  a  few  filters,  corresponding  to  a  few  angles,  are  employed  and  the  intermediate responses are interpolated. With a correct filter set and  interpolation  rule,  it  becomes  possible  to  evaluate  a  filter  of  any  arbitrary orientation.    Feature Extraction    In this paper we use the orientation filter at the first-level to generate  a feature vector for distinguishing between different gestures. At the  second-level  the  silhouette  of  the  different  gestures  is  extracted,  followed  by  the  generation  of  the  corresponding  skeleton  and  the  evaluation  of  the  gradients  at  its  end  points.  This  constitutes  the  second feature set, for recognizing those gestures which remain to be   identified at the first-level.              Fig.3. Sample gestures (a) Before  preprocessing (b) After preprocessing     Train set    There are twenty three training sets of images, each one  containing  three  images.  Each  set  originates  from  a  single  image  for  testing.  Three  operations  were  carried  out  in  all  of  the  images.  They  were  converted  to  grayscale,  the  background  was  made    uniform  and  applied  spatial  transformations  (Rotation  and  Scaling  )  (Fig.  4.).  A  spatial transformation (also known as a geometric operation) modifies  the spatial  relationship  between  pixels  in  an image,  mapping    pixel  locations in an input image to new locations in an output image. The  toolbox  includes  functions  that  perform  certain  specialized  spatial  transformations, such as resizing and rotating an image. In addition,  the  toolbox  includes  functions  that  you  can    use  to  perform  many  types  of  2-D  and  N-D  spatial  transformations,  including  custom  transformations: Rotation and Scaling.    The final form of database would be:      Fig.4. Spatial transformations for sample mudra (i) Original   image Gyanmudra (ii) Rotated image (iii) Resized image               Fig. 5.  Pattern Recognition System        The pattern recognition system that will be used can be seen in Fig. 5.  Some  transformation  T,  converts  an  image  into  a  feature  vector,  which will be then compared with feature vectors of a training set of  gestures. Histogram orientation has the advantage of being robust in   lighting  change  conditions.  If  we  follow  the  pixel  -intensities  approach certain problems can arise for varying illumination. Taking  a pixel-by-pixel difference of the  same photo under different lighting  conditions would show a large distance between these two identical  gestures. Orientation analysis should give robustness in illumination   changes while histogramming will offer translational invariance. This  method  will  work  if  examples  of  the  same  gesture  map  to  similar  orientation  histograms,  and  different  gestures  map  to  substantially  different histograms[4] and [5].    Edge Orientation Histogram    Considering  the  aspects  of  translation  and  scaling  invariance,  the  orientation histogram [2] was found to be a useful feature component.  Here  these  constitute  histograms  of  local  orientation  of  the  hand  gesture.  The  orientation  histograms  are  robust  to  illumination  changes,  and  are  simple  and  fast  to  compute.  Local  orientation  is  obtained by the use of steerable filters,  in which a filter of arbitrary  orientation is synthesized  as  a linear  combination  of  a  set  of  "basis  filters".  A  set  of  36  one-dimensional  Gaussian  steerable  filters  and  their  first  order  derivatives  have  been used   for  extracting the  local  edge orientation properties of the hand gesture for every 10°, ranging  from  0°  to  350°.  The  gesture  image  I,  filtered  at  an  arbitrary  orientation and convolved with the filters, can be synthesized for   the oriented filter response       where * represents the convolution operator, and G0 an arbitrary orientation 0.       1 is considered at                    International Journal of Current Research, Vol. 5, Issue, 6, pp.1457-1462, June, 2013   1460    In order to enhance the ability of the edge orientation histogram  in  recognizing  the  rotated  gestures,  the  direction  of  maximum  local  orientation of every gesture is found. Accordingly the original gesture  image  is rotated in  such  a  manner  that the  maximum  orientation  is  obtained at 180°. The edges of the hand gesture are extracted using  the  Laplacian  of  Gaussians (LOG)  [1],  and  the image  is  multiplied  with the filter response for every value of 0. Fig. 6 illustrates the polar  plots  of  the  edge  orientation  histogram  corresponding  to  the  edges  from the gestures "Anjali", "Shanka", "Chakra" and "Pushpaputa".      for the connectivity graph starting from one end point (typically, the  leftmost point). Preference is provided to a node with a lower weight  during the traversal. Thereby, the number of backtracking sequences  gets reduced.            Fig. 8 . Depth-first traversal in edge connectivity graph of sample gesture    The  thick  black  lines  in  Fig.  8  indicate  the  depth-first  traversal  sequence  of  the  connectivity  graph  of  Fig.  7(iv).  The  sequence  obtained is expressed as     G -> F -> I -> H -> I -> K -> J -> K -> L -> K -> I -> F -> D -> E ->  D -> C -> B -> C -> A.     Repetitions of nodes correspond to the backtracking of edges during  traversal of the graph.     For  every  end  point  in  the  skeleton,  the  nearest  boundary  point  is  obtained.  Without  loss  of  generality,  it  can  be  inferred  that  this  nearest boundary point will be either a finger tip or a point in the hand  gesture  where  the  curvature  change  is  large.  Hence  the  gradient  at  these points will significantly vary over the different gestures. For the  branch  points,  this  value  is  assigned  to  be  zero  in  order  to  avoid  unnecessary  weights  due  to  backtracking  sequences.  The  values  of  gradients are then substituted for the nodes, in the depth-first traversal  sequence.  This  sequence  of  gradients  and  zeros  forms  the  feature  vector for the second-level of recognition.    Edge Detection    The edge is a set of those pixels whose grey have the step change and  rooftop change, and it exists between object and background object  and  object  region  and  region  between  element  and  element.  When  image is acquired the factors as projection, mix, aberrance and noise  are produced. Above mention factors bring on image features blur and   distortion,  due  to  this  it  is  difficult  to  detect  edge.  In  process  of  noising  we  use  a  “Gaussian  Noise  removal  of  image  on  the  local  feature”  after  then  we  apply  different  operators’  e.g  Binary  Morphology operators, canny operator, log operator, and differential  operator for edge detection [11]. The image can be affected by noise  inevitably in the process of saving and transmission and noise causes  the  negative  effect  on  the  image  processing  and  analysis.  For  removing  these  effects,  it  is  necessary  to  remove  or  decrease  the  noise, at the same time conserve the image information as much as   possible, such as edge and the texture.    Image De-noising    Gaussian noise model has a very significant feature, it does not matter  how much the variance and histogram of the original image is it will  always  follows  the  Gauss  distribution.  In  Gaussian  method  firstly  according  to  the  feature  that  in  the  image  the  local  neighbourhood  pixel in the same object are smooth, we estimate  whether the pixel                        (i)                     (ii)                     (iii)                  (iv)             Fig. 6.

Polar plots of corresponding edge orientation histograms of gestures   Anjali, Shanka, Chakra and Pushpaputa    Gradients at Corner Points of Skeleton    Those gestures that cannot be recognized at the first-level, by the use  of  edge  orientation  histograms,  are  processed  further  at  a  second- level.  It  is  known  that the  end points  of  a  skeleton  correspond to  a  change of  curvature. Refined categorization is next made, using the  gradients at the extremities of the skeleton as a new set of features. A  given gray scale image is initially binarized in a uniform manner over  hand gestures of different people. The boundary is extracted from the   binary  image,  followed  by  the  flood-fill  operation  to  generate  a  uniform  silhouette.  This  is  depicted  in  Fig.  7(i)  for  a sample  dance  gesture.        Fig. 7. Sample gesture (i) Silhouette, (ii) Boundary, (iii) Skeleton and    (iv) Connectivity graph.     The skeleton [Fig. 7(iii)] is extracted by the morphological operation  of  thinning.  Typically  it  consists  of  a  number  of  branch  points  and  end points, connected by curve segments. These points are considered  to be the nodes of a graph, such that the skeletal curve segments form  the edges. This graph [Fig. 7(iv)] is called the connectivity graph of   the  skeleton.  It  provides  topological  information  about  the  hand  gesture.  Matching  of  the  connectivity  graphs,  based  on  their  topologies  and  geometric  features,  provides  a  distance  measure  for  determining  the  similarity  (or  dissimilarity)  between  the  different  shapes. The adjacency matrix of the connectivity graph is constructed.  The degree of every node in the graph is computed and assigned as its  weight. Subsequently, a depth-first traversal sequence is constructed                    International Journal of Current Research, Vol. 5, Issue, 6, pp.1457-1462, June, 2013   1461    point is on the image edge, the noise point or the edge texture point  [4]. Then according to the local continuity of the image edge and the   texture feature, using the continuity of the image. And then locate the  noise  points.  Lastly  for  the  noise  which  is  not  on  the  edge  or  the  texture. Using the mean value of the non-noise points in the adaptive  neighbourhood to eliminate the noise, and for the noise on the edge  and texture  region  just  using  the  pixel points  of  the  neighbourhood  edge  and    texture to  smooth.  With  the  help  of  this  method  we  can  remove the Gaussian noise in the image well and the number of the  residual noise points decreases sharply.    Experimental Results    Fig.15  shows the Pop-up menu to select the gesture for recognition  either from test setor from trainset.      Fig.15.  shows  the  pop-menu  for  the  user  to  select  the  particular  gesture to display the hand gesture.      Fig. 16. Distinctly identifiable gestures at the first-level.

The gesture vocabulary was built by capturing ten images of each of  the 23 double hand gestures of Bharatanatyam from the hands of three  different  people,  using  a  five  megapixel  camera.  These  ten  images  were  translated,  rotated,  scaled  and  reflected  versions  of  a  single  gesture.  Hence every  image  is  unique.  Out  of  the ten images,  eight  were randomly selected for training the system, while the remaining  two  were kept  for  testing.  This  amounted to  a  total  of  224 training  images. The test images were identified based on the closest match to  the learned examples (prototypes) in terms of Euclidean distance. In  the first-level, orientation histogram was  used for feature extraction.  In the second-level a shape-based skeleton matching was used, with  the gradients at the corner points being used as a new set of features.     Fig. 15. Pop-up menu        Fig.17.

These  are  Anjali,  Shanka,  Chakra  and  Pushpaputa , as shown in Fig. 16. The remaining 19 gestures could be  grouped into three classes, as indicated by the three rows of Fig. 17.   These 19 images were used for subsequent processing at the second- level,  as described  below.  Shape-based skeleton  matching  was next  used,    with the  set  of  gradients  at  the  corner  points  in the  skeleton  serving as the new set of features for  the remaining 192 (= 224  –   32) training images. The skeleton of the test image of a hand gesture  was  first  obtained,  and  its  connectivity  graph  generated.  Then  a  depth-first traversal sequence with the gradient values was computed,  for use as the feature  vector. The left-most point of a skeleton image  was  generally  considered  as  the  starting  point  of  the  depth-first  traversal  for  every  gesture.  Since  all  gestures  are  rotated  to  give  a  maximum orientation at 180°, therefore it is safe to assume that for  the same gesture the starting point will be the same. The matching of  two  shapes  now  reduces  to  the  problem  of  matching  two  feature  sequences. Let V and U be two such sequences of lengths n and m  respectively.  Using  concepts  from  dynamic  programming,  a  cost   function Cost(i,j) is defined as the cost of matching the ith element Vi  of the first sequence with the jth element Uj of the second sequence. It  is defined as                     International Journal of Current Research, Vol. 5, Issue, 6, pp.1457-1462, June, 2013   1462    Cost(i,j)=min{Cost(I,  j-1),Cost(i-1,  j),  Cost(i-1,  j-1)}+Weight(Vi)  *Vi-weight(Uj)*Uj                                                                (2)    In order to match the sequences V and U, one needs to compute the  cost  over  their  entire  length.  It  is evident that the  value  of  the  cost  function  determines  the  similarity  (or  dissimilarity)  between  the  shapes of different hand gestures. There are, however, possibilities of  error due to the irregularities in the skeleton structure from the hands  of different people with different textural properties.     Conclusion    This paper would be a very practical, simple and cost-effective  mode  of  imparting  training  in  the  nuances  of  traditional  dance  across  the  globe, thereby assimilating the cultural divide between the Orient and  the West. We aim to make the computer act as a teacher to correct the  dance  gestures  for  the  purpose  of  promoting  classical  Indian  dance  across  the  world.  A  simple  and  new  two-level  decision  making  system has been designed for recognizing the samyuktha gestures of  Bharatanatyam, a well-known Indian classical dance form. It has been   shown  to  be  scale-,  translation-    and  rotation-invariant  while  recognizing various double-hand gestures of a dancer.    REFERENCES    1.   William  T.

This  dance  is  culturally  relevant  to  Asian  Indian  American  students,  but  the  findings  are  applicable  to  students  from  other  demographics  that  are  interested in learning math through dance. Many Asian Indian students learn Bharatanatyam for cultural  maintenance  and  preservation.  Dance  is also  a beneficial  medium  to  teach  basic geometric  shapes  to  young children because dance is an engaging art curriculum that can be used in schools.  This mixed  methods  study  informed  by  categorical  content  analysis  is  designed  to  recommend  a  framework  for  exploring  how  Asian  Indian  students  can  learn  basic  geometric  shapes  through  Bharatanatyam.  The  study  investigates  dance  movements  called  adavus,  cultural  relevance,  and  integration  of  elements  from  dance and  geometry  and  the implementation  of  alternate  strategies  such  as  dance instruction  to  teach  and  learn  basic  geometric  shapes.  The  data  analysis  revealed  the  benefits  of  dance  and  math  integration.    Key words: Asian Indian students, Bharatanatyam, geometry, learning styles, teaching and learning.       INTRODUCTION    For  centuries  dance  has  been  regarded  as  an  aesthetic  experience, an entertaining work of art, and a vehicle for  gratification.  History  also  demonstrates  that  dance  (synchronized  kinesthetic  art)  has  been  utilized  in  other  areas  such  as  psychology,  counseling,  and  medicine  (Chodorow, 2013; Bracilovic, 2009; Meekums, 2015). For  example,  dance  has  been  used  in  treating  depression,  teaching  languages  and  mathematics.  Lazonov  (1981)’s  experimentation with ballet dancers and opera singers to  teach young children how to read is a classic example of  practical use of dance. His ‘suggestopedia’ made learning     *Corresponding author.

This  clearly  demonstrates  that  dance  has  utilitarian  purpose  because,  in  addition  to  its  aesthetic  appeal,  it  has  established  instructional  benefits.  It  is  established  that  “Incorporating  music,  art,  role-playing  and  games  into  the  curriculum”  made  the  lessons  engaging  to  learners  (Cook,  et  al,  2013;  Dale,  1946,  1996;  Prichard  and  Taylor,  1981,  22).  The  systematic  body  movement  through  dancing  is  used  to  support learning. In this paper, I explore the integration of  dance and the teaching of mathematics, specifically basic  therapeutic,  cognitive  and                    geometric  shapes  using  the  Asian  Indian  dance  called  Bharatanatyam.       Background    Bharatnatyam  is  orchestrated  body  movements  that  are  synchronized  to  Carnatic  music.  Unlike  other  western  dance  styles,  Bharatnatyam  dances  are  performed  to  describe  the  stories  sung  using  vocal  and  instrumental  music.  The  Asian  Indian  dance  called  Bharatanatyam  is  more  than  coordinated  and  stylized  movements.  It  is  a  semiotic  medium,  which  incorporates  schematized  body  movement,  music,  and  paralinguistic  features  to  tell  stories  from  the  Hindu  epics  (e.g.,  Ramayana  and  Mahabharata).  This  highly  codified  style  of  dance  originated in the state of Tamil Nadu in South India in the  4th century (Banerjee 2013; Sangeetha and Ragothaman,  2014).  The  term,  Bharatanatyam  is  a  compound  word  from  the  Sanskrit  language  meaning:  bha  /expression+  ra/music+  tha/rhythm+  and  natya/dance).  It  was  sage  Bharata  muni  that created  this  transmediated  practice  of  storytelling.  Later,  in  the  20th  century,  Rukmini  Devi  Arundal  introduced  Bharatnatyam  to  the  west  (Samson,  2010).    In Bharatanatyam, there is a tacit element of instruction  -  the  dancer/teacher  guides  the  audiences  through  codified  bodily  movements  and  schematized  expression  (Ramanath,  2009).  One  example  is  the  Jathi  interpreted  by  Savitha  Shastry,  dance  master  of  the  Kalakshetra  school  link  http://safeshare.tv/w/iegEtLKOnM)  (see  appendix  A  for  permission  from  the  author).  Here,  the  dancer  creates  rigorous  geometric  movements  that  correspond  to  the  shapes  taught  in  mathematics  class.  The  following  section  discusses  the  video  and  mathematics  instruction  including how dance can be used to teach math.      Video    This  dance  is  called  Jathi,  which  is  a  series  of  steps  (referred to as adavus in Bahratanatyam) strung together  in a meaningful way.       Geometric shapes    The various geometrical shapes that are formed with the  first line comprising “Tha Dhi Thaka Thakadi Thajum” are  -  triangle,  right  angle,  line  segment,  diagonal,  half  circle,  circle,  diamond,  and  obtuse  and  acute  angles.  Similar  and many other figures emerge as the dance progresses.  The  visual,  spatial,  and  aesthetic  elements  are  visible  in  this  Jathi.  Bharatnatyam  enables  the  learner  to  use  the  aesthetic  elements  while  learning  the  basic  geometric  shapes   (see   appendix   D   for   shapes).  Dietiker  and    Bharatnatyam   video   (see   of      Kalpana           7         Brakoniecki  (2014)  point  out  that  aesthetic  dimension  of  mathematics  learning  experiences  is  not  addressed  in  schools and it needs attention.   is   taught  using    During  the  author’s  observations  of  young  adults  learning  Bharatanatyam,  she  realized  that  dance  could  be  used  to  teach  children  valuable  skills  including  basic  geometric  shapes  such  as  line,  square,  rectangle,  and  triangle.  Geometry  textbooks  and  worksheets  at  school  to  help  students  master  the  concepts  precisely.  These  linguistic  materials  help  children learn and practice math concepts.  However, the  visual  and  kinesthetic  learners  in  our  classrooms  may  depend  on  other  modalities  to  learn  math  and  according  to Dietiker and Brakoniecki (2014, 33) “...There are many  questions  that  remain  unanswered  about  how  diagrams  are  used  by  texts,  teachers,  and  students.  Possibly,  some  reading  diagrams…may be  overcome by explicitly supporting the  different  ways  students  read  geometrically”.  Hence,  dance  may  be  an  engaging  and  appropriate  medium,  to  help  students,  especially  students  who  are  visual  and  kinesthetic learners, learn basic geometric shapes.    confusion   potential   the   of   of   tinker,   dance,   decide,   “choreograph,   revise,  play,  apply,   Bharatnatyam  is  also  an  expressive  dance  form  that  uses  semiotics,  storytelling,  music,  culture,  religion,  mathematics,  philosophy,  and  history  and  this  dance  is  used  to  help  children  of  Asian  Indian  origin  to  become  culturally  grounded.  Apart  from  learning  to  express  through  dance,  children  also  learn  the  various  concepts  that  are  required  to  understand  mathematics  through  dance  (Jiesamfoek  2012;  Klingenberg,  2012;  McCarthy- Brown 2014). Further, Rodenfeld (2013,  213) recognizes  the  skill  set  needed  in  both  of  these  disciplines  of  math  collaborate,  and  experiment,  represent,  analyze,  discover.  Most  of  these  words  can  be  used  to  describe  mathematical  problem  solving  as  well  as  a  choreographic  process.”  Subsequently,  integration  of  math and dance may be cognitively beneficial to children  who are familiar  with math and dance concepts because  “cognition  is  the  emergent  outcome  of  dynamic  and  adaptive  sensorimotor  interactions  with  the  social  and  physical  environment”  (Semin  and  Smith,  2013,  125).  Before  analyzing  the  effects  of  integrating  math  and  dance, we should examine how math is taught in schools.      Mathematics instruction in school    Several  researchers  note  how  traditionally  mathematics  has been taught predominantly using the lecture method.  teacher-centered  with  a  passive,  This  approach  sedentary  to  solve  problems  through  rote  memorization  (Dunn  and  Dunn,  2012;  Galeet,  2012;  Westreich,  2012;  Yang  and  Dai  2011).    Such  traditional  methods  privilege  only  one  channel or mode of understanding – the linguistic. These  methods do not  accommodate  the  variety  of learners in    learner  who  works   isolation   in   is      8            J. Studio Fine Art        classrooms today. It is not my intention to disparage rote- memorization because dance media (e.g.,  Bharatanatyam)  is  also  learned  through  memorization;  however,  dance  uses  different  modalities  to  teach  various  concepts  to  learners.     Among  students  there  is  a  feeling  that  math  is  a  hard  subject. Teachers often report that children either get it or  do  not (Cornell,  1999;  Duru, 2010). Further,  Dietiker and  Brakoniecki  (2014,  6)  clarify  “it  is  not  surprising  that  learning  mathematics  appears  to  many  students  as  a  game  where  the  rules  seem  arbitrary  and  hidden.”  Traditional  methods  disengage  students  who  learn  differently  using  alternate  methods  of  learning  (Ultanir,  2012,  198).  Therefore,  teachers  must  look  for  innovative  teaching  strategies  to  help  struggling  students  in  their  math  classes.  Further,  alternate  teaching  methods  may  produce  higher  engagement  in  students  (Werner,  1978;  Zakaria,  2013).  Westreich  (2002)  recommends  dance  to  teach math because dance is an engaging modality and it  may help students visualize a problem. In addition, dance  may  be  an  appealing  vehicle  to  help  visual  and  kinesthetic  learners  to  understand  the  basic  geometric  shapes such as square, rectangle, triangle, and diamond.  Dietiker  (2014,  1)  argues,  “Students  are  expected  to  develop  sophisticated  ways  to  interpret  diagrams  using  context  and  convention.”  For  some  students,  such  deduction of figures may be difficult or impossible unless  an  alternate  method  of  teaching  is  employed.  Teachers  have  recognized  the  benefits  of  teaching  math  using  interactive  and  engaging  methods  (Dale,  1946,  1996;  Klingenberg,  2012;  and  Redmond,  2011).  For  example,  “SHINE’s curriculum uses kinesthetic learning to help our  students  better  understand  and  retain  material.  More  importantly,  it  helps  excite  our  students  about  math,  and  changes  their  attitudes  about  their  own  potential”  (Shine  for Girls, 2014, 1). SHINE for Girls is a program designed  by  Shah,  a  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  researcher  to  help  girls  to  excel  in  STEM  fields.  The  founder  and  director  of  SHINE  is  a  dance  professional,  who combines math and dance to teach girls about math  concepts.  Therefore,  Bharatanatyam  may  be  an  engaging  alternate  method  for  students  who  have  the  prior knowledge and experience of this dance to learn the  basic geometric shapes.       LITERATURE REVIEW    There  is  copious  research  on  the  topic  of  integration  of  mathematics  and  dance  (Werner,  1978;  Brillon,  2014;  and  Rosenfeld,  2013),  but  there  were  no  studies  that  looked  at  teaching  geometry  utilizing  Bharatanatyam.  Research  has  shown  that  dance  can  be  integrated  in  teaching  math  while teachers  explore  “a meaningful  way  to  encourage  to  traditional teaching” (Cook et al.,  2013,  598).  Also,  new    to  consider  alternatives   [students]              approaches  to  problems  of  teaching  number  theory  through  embodied  movement  and  dance  is  sought  after  (Dale, 1946, 1996; Devichi and Munier, 2013). In addition,  Rosenfeld (2013,  211)  claims  that  dance facilitates  math  learning  including  concepts  such  as,  "congruence,  symmetry, transformation, angles and degrees, attributes,  pattern  recognition,  symbols,  and  mapping  on  a  coordinate grid.”    Zuckerbros  (2011)  describes  a  6th  grade  teacher’s  approach  to  guiding  her  students  to  choreograph  a  dance. Through her strategy, the teacher encouraged her  students  to  learn  elements  of  geometry  and  write  the  directions  to  recreate  the  dance.  Rosenfeld  (2013),  a  trained  percussive  dancer,  uses  dance  to  teach  her  elementary  students  to  learn  to  create  different  shapes.  She  helps  her  students  understand  how  math  is  not  just  figurative  depiction,  but  a  thought  process.  Rosenfeld  teaches her students to take responsibility while learning  by  creating  an  environment  where  students  can  experiment and later  discover the shapes  by  themselves  instead  of  depending  on  the  teacher  to  dictate  to  them  (Jiesamfoek, 2012; Tomlinson, 2011).    the   basic   shapes   geometric   According  to  McCarthy-Brown  (2014,  128),  “dance  is  an  expression  of  culture  and  through  dance,  cultural  traditions  are  preserved,  lived,  shared,  and  explored.”  Along with cultural preservation, it is also established that  dance can be utilized to teach math; however, there is no  specific  study  on  Bharatanatyam  and  math.  This  mixed  methods  study  examines  the  students’  understanding  of  learning  using  Bharatanatyam.

Theoretical framework     This  study  draws  from  social  constructivism  (Steedman,  2000;  Shoval,  2011;  Young  and  Collin,  2004),  theory  of  multiple  intelligences  (Gardner,  1988),  and  semiotics  (Sipe, 1998). Social constructivism theorists "believe that  much  can  be  learned  from  investigating  an  individual's  sense-making  strategies  as  he  or  she  attempts  to  understand  mathematical  ideas"  (Lambdin and Westcott,  2007,  15).    The  concept  of  integrating  knowledge  from  one domain into another can be applied to dance learning  because  like  math,  dance  utilizes  the  same  concepts  of  sense making and comprehension of ideas (Brillon, 2014;    teaching,  specifically   to              Steedman,  2000;  Westreich  2012).  The  learner  builds  knowledge based  on her understanding of the  world and  the interaction with the materials presented.   includes  semantic   Semiotics  is  the  study  of  different  sign  systems.  Semiotics  (meaning),  syntactic  (structure), and pragmatic (effect) characteristics (Barthes  1987). The semantic aspect comes from the word(s) and  context, while the syntactic is the grammatical structures,  and  the  pragmatic  is  the  effect  the  signs  have  on  the  reader,  listener,  or  watcher.  Bharatanatyam  uses  the  different  sign  systems  such  as  music,  dance,  and  expression  to  convey  the  same  message,  which  is  transmediation  of  the  sign  systems  (Magee  and  Leeth,  2014).  Transmediation  is  “the  process  of  translating  meaning  from  one  sign  system  (such  as  language)  to  another such as pictures)” (Siegel 1995). This method of  learning  helps  students  construct  knowledge  not  just  by  using  through  painting,  dancing,  singing,  dialoging,  and  acting  (Fauth  1990;  Zakaria  et  al  2013).  Transmediation  helps  promote  different  ways  of  knowing  and  not  just  the  linguistic  modes of representation (Siegel, 1995).    language,  but  also   text  or   it   is  a  multiplicative  process   Transmediation  is  the  connection  between  two  sign  systems  that  has  to  be  created  through  critical  thinking  and  (Tembrioti  and  Tsangardou, 2014). Nodelman observes that words have  a  greater  potential  for  conveying  temporal  information,  whereas  pictures  have  a  greater  potential  for  conveying  spatial  100).  Further,  transmediation  can  produce  a  higher  level  of  learning.  Hence,  teaching  geometric  shapes  through  dance  may  enable  students  the  skill  set  quickly  as  compared  to  teaching  using  the  traditional  methods  of  lecturing and through board work (Jensen, 2000).     information   to  grasp   1998,   (Sipe   Multiple   logical/mathematical   intelligences  accommodate  students  with  different  learning  styles  in  our  classrooms.  Gardner  identifies seven different kinds of learning styles and I am  focusing  on  the  four  styles  applicable  for  this  study.  Bharatnatyam  dancers  can  be  visual,  spatial/kinesthetic,  auditory, and logical/mathematical. Visual learners expect  pictorial  aids  and  other  illustrations  to  help  them  learn.  Spatial/kinesthetic  learners  understand  the  lesson  if  taught  using  bodily  movement  and  heuristic  learning  activities.  Auditory  learners  seek  out  aural  instructions  and  for  information  presented  in  a  calculating  and  analytical  fashion  (Gardner  1999).  Bhartanatyam  uses  all  of  these  intelligences  through  movements (exit, entry,  poses,  and  positioning  on  stage  while  dancing),  music  (tonal  semiotics),  and  formations  (simulation  and  coordination  including  stage  movements).  According  to  Poursabahian  (2012, 25):  …When  a  struggling  student  suddenly  gets  a  certain  adavu  or  kannakku  (the  math  behind  a  complex  set  of  adavus)  because  of  an  innovative  instructional  tweak  on  my part,  the  thrill  and  sense  of  satisfaction  is  beyond    learners  may   look      Kalpana           9         words.

METHODOLOGY    Participants    The following section is a description of the participants’ information.  The participants of this study were Asian Indian American students  attending  schools  in  three  major  cities  in  the  southwest  region  of  the  United  States.    The  participants  were  recruited  using  a  flyer  at  various  dance  schools  in  three  major  cities  in  the  Southwest  (see  appendix  B  for  the  flyer).  All  of  the  participants  are  second  generation  Asian  Indian  Americans,  who  live  and  go  to  schools  in  the US. The study participants ranged from ages four to eighteen.    The  study  participants  were  classified  as  (a)  students  who  have  the  first  hand  knowledge  of  Bharatanatyam  and  Carnatic  music  because  either  they  or  their siblings  are  learning  the  arts  and  they  attend  dance  and  music  recitals  and  programs  with  their  family  periodically,  (b)  students  who  have  no  exposure  to  dance,  and  (c)  students with cursory knowledge of dance. Some of the participants  are attached to music or dance school that teaches using the guru- shisya approach of teaching (Banerjee, 2012). This dance requires  students to learn from a teacher who is trained in a specific style of  Indian  music  or  dance.  The  schools  of  Bharatnatyam  include  Kalkshetra,  Pandannluru,  Melattur,  Tanjavoor,  and  Vazhuvoor  and  these  styles  are  region  specific  to  the  south  Indian  states  of  Karnataka,  Andra  Pradesh,  and  Tamil  Nadu.    Music  schools  are  either  Hindustani  (North  Indian)  or  Carnatic  styles  (South  Indian).  The  participants  in  this  study  were  from  elementary  to  university  level,  who  have  exposure  to  dance  and  music  through  the  dance  and  music  schools  and  the  regional  organizations  to  which  they  belong.       Participants’ classification    Data  was  analyzed  by  classifying  Bharatnatyam  students  as  follows-  (a)  students  with  experience,  (b)  students  with  minimal  exposure  and  to  Bharatanatyam. Table 1 illustrates the classification.      Date collection    The author provided the study participants with a YouTube video of  a Jathi performed by Savitha Shastry and asked them to watch and  then  identify  the  different  geometrical  shapes  as  presented  in  the  dance. Dr. Iyengar emailed the YouTube clip using ‘safe share TV’  link and gave each one of the students three weeks time to respond  to her email request. Due to lack of responses after three weeks of  her  initial  request,  the  author  resent  the  email  and  gave  them  a  week’s extension for those who had not replied to  her first request.  After  the  fourth  week,  she  received  detailed  descriptions  from  twenty  participants.  The  data  for  this  study  comprised  answers  to  three questions that the students answered (Table 2). The first two  questions  are  brief  responses  and  the  third  question  is  a  narrative  response, where students write about how they can or cannot learn  basic geometric shapes using Bharatanatyam. Data were collected  through written email responses and it was stored in a wiki created  for this study.   (c)  students  without  much  exposure      10            J.

Explain why or why not.         Research design     The  study  utilized  categorical  content  analysis,  a  type  of  mixed  methods  design  where  the  researcher  categorizes  the  text  by  analyzing  units  of  text  (Leiblich  et  al.,  1998).    In  addition,  the  parallel form of mixed methods using a conversion design in which  qualitative data can be converted into quantitative data was utilized  (Mertens,  2010).  Categorical  analysis  is  dividing  the  text  into  smaller units for analysis. Parallel form is collecting both qualitative  and  quantitative  data  simultaneously.  The  quantitative  data  was  collected  and  analyzed  to  draw  conclusions  from  the  results  (see  step 4).   Categorical  analysis  is  conducted  using  the  following  steps  (Leiblich  et  al.,  1998,  113-114):  (1)  Selection  of  the  subtext,  (2)  Definition  of  the  Content  Categories,  (3)  Sorting  the  Material  into  Categories, and (4) Drawing Conclusions from the Results.    The  Selection  of  Subtext  is  classifying  text  as  a  separate  unit  depending  on  the  research  question.  For  instance,  this  study  is  looking  into  teaching  basic  geometric  shapes  through  dance  and  hence the narrative responses of the participants can be subdivided  into  shapes  recognized  and  skills  learned.  All  of  the  other  information is ignored in the selected text.        Definition  of  the  Content  is  the  different  theories  or  themes  that   emerge in the text.    The  categories  are  driven  by  a  theory  and  in  this  study;  the  content  is  defined  based  on  the  different  learning  styles  used  to  understand  the  basic  geometric  shapes  in  the  dance  jathi.  For  example,  (2009)  multiple  intelligences  theory  of  learning.  The  categories  are  defined  using  the theory depending on the sub texts chosen for analyses.    this  study  draws   from  Gardner’s   Sorting  the  Materials  into  Categories  is  analyzing  discrete  sentences from the data set. This step calls for an external reader’s  assistance so validity can be established. Leblich et al. (1998, 113- 114) describe that “When two or more judges are involved in sorting  contents  into  categories,  this  can  be  done  independently,  to  allow  the calculation of the interjudge reliability, or jointly, to create higher  sensitivity to the text and its meaning to different readers.”    The author consulted a Pandannaluru style Bharatnatyam dance  teacher  to  cross  check  the  data  analysis  and  offer  comments.  Except  for  the  skill  sets  discussed  in  the  paper,  she  consented  to  my  findings  to  be  accurate.  She  recommended  that  the  author  reword  the  skills  sets  identified  in  the  limitations  and  implications  section of the article. The author rephrased the categories later.   Finally, Drawing Conclusion from the  Results  involves  statistical               Kalpana           11     Figure 1. Geometric shapes and frequency in twenty participants.      identified   the  study  participants         computations  of  the  sentences  and  categories.  For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  a  figure  (Figure  1)  is  included  with  the  number  of  geometrical  shapes  through  watching  the  dance  and  a  pie  chart  with  percentages  of  figures  identified  by  participants.  The  author  will  use  “…the  contents  collected  in  each  category  …descriptively  to  formulate  a  picture  of  the  content  universe  in  certain  groups  of  people  or  cultures”  (Leblich et al., 1998, 114).       Data analysis    Data was analyzed using categorical content analysis supported by  Leiblich  et  al.  (1998).  First,  subtexts  were  selected  from  the  participant  responses.  Then,  the  sub  texts  were  categorized,  and  finally,  a  statistical  procedure  was  applied.  These  four  different  steps were applied to all of the texts collected in this study, but the  following  section  lists  two  examples  (data)  for  each  step.  The  participants are identified with numbers.      The selection of the subtext    No,  geometry  is  much  more  complicated  than  what  is  in  a  dance  and the steps. The steps and shapes made in a dance are simple,  only  scratching  the  surface  of  the  complicated  math  involved  in  geometry (1)   I  am  concerned  with  the  identification  of  shapes  here,  so  I  will  select  this  section  of  the  text  for  analysis  -  The  steps  and  shapes  made in the dance are simple (1)   I believe that I can use dance to learn Math concepts, specifically  geometry,  by  using  dance.  The  turning  of  the  body  with  the  two  hands  at  a  right  angle  can  represent  the  circumference  of  a  circle  while  the  hand  stretch  outwardly  can  represent  the  radius  of  a  circle.  The  placement  of  hands  diagonally  can  represent  a  cut  through  a  shape.  The  ending  pose  can  represent  the  vertices  (multiple vertex) of a pentagon (3)    I  will  select  the  subtext  that  discusses  body  movements  to  form  a  circle - The turning of the body with the two hands at a right angle  can represent the circumference of a circle  while  the  hand  stretch       outwardly can represent the radius of a circle (3)    Definition of the Content:  The text was categorized based on my  perceptions  of  how  the  participants  observed  their  learning  using  one or more of the multiple intelligences. The analysis is based on  the responses to the questions I posed to the participants.     The  placement  of  hands  diagonally  can  represent  a  cut  through  a  shape. The ending pose can represent the vertices (multiple vertex)  of a pentagon. When I dance this, it is clear to me (5)    This  dancer  is  both  visual  and  kinesthetic  learner.  She  needs  to  picture  the  shapes  formed  and  she  needs  to  perform  the  shapes  herself through bodily movements to better understand the shapes.    Yes, I think we can do math using dance because every move they  make they could measure it and add it up and get the total. I would  prefer to do geometry using dancing because it is fun and I have to  search what shapes Ms. Shastry is making while she is dancing (8)  This  dancer  is  kinesthetic,  spatial,  and  logical  thinker.  He  prefers  precision  through  observing  the  shapes.  He  also  likes  to  seek  out  information while watching the visual representation of the shapes.      Sorting of the materials into categories    The  texts  were  categorized  based  on  Piaget’s  framework  of  reasoning.  The  participants  ranged  from  kindergarten  (6  years)  to  college  (18  years).  The  recognition  of  shapes  correlated  with  their  ages.  For  example,  the  participants  in  kinder  to  second  grades  were  able  to  identify  line,  diagonal,  and  a  few  angles.  Participants  from third grades to eight grades identified all of the shapes that the  kinder  to  third  grade  recognized  and  triangle,  square,  rectangle,  circle, and parallelogram. The last set of students wrote down all of  the  previously  mentioned  shapes  and  the  following  shapes  –  trapezoid,  diamond,  acute  and  obtuse  angles,  rhombus,  and  hexagon.    Piaget’s  frame  suggests  how  children  process  information  and  how  it  is  dependent  upon  one’s  age.  Piaget’s  research  also  suggests three stages in children’s understanding of materials. The  three cognitive developmental stages are – (1) pre-operational, (2)     •Line, 20•Diagnol, 20•Angle, 20•Triangle, 15•Square, 15•Rectangle, 15•Circle, 15•Trapezoid, 5•Diamond, 5•Acute Angle, 5  Obtuse Angles, 5•Rhombus, 5•Hexagon, 5    to  several   features.  The     12            J. Studio Fine Art        concrete  operational,  and  (3)  formal  operational.  According  to  Piaget (as cited in Ultanir, 2012, 46),    The  pre-operational child between the  ages of 2 and  7 years uses  language  and  represents  objects  by  images  and  words.  The  concrete  operational  child  between  the  ages  of  7  and  11  can  classify  objects  according  formal  operational  young  adult  between  the  ages  of  11  and  up  becomes  concerned  with  the  hypothetical,  future,  ideological  problems.  The  data  collected  for  this  study  aligns  with  Piaget’s  stages  and  the  following section lists examples from data that conforms to Piaget’s  framework of reasoning.      Pre-operational    Lines and  diagonal…It is fun to learn  math using dance that is not  done in school (16).  This writer recognizes the basic shapes and mentions how they do  not  learn  math  in  a  fun  way.  They  prefer  learning  math-utilizing  dance.    Angles  and  lines  all  over…Dance  helps  me  memorize  the  angles  and lines (19)  This participant also identified the basic shapes and acknowledged  that  dance  aided  them  in  memorization  of  the  shapes.  This  participant is able to identify one important skill necessary for both  dance and math – memorization of concepts.      Concrete operational    Circle,  trapizoid,  triangle,  square,  rectangle…  That  would  be  awesome  to  learn  Math  by  dance.  Math  is  boring  because  the  teachers write on the board or talk all the time. If dance is used then  we  have  to  move  and  there  will  be  excitement  in  class.  I  think,  geometric  shapes  like  I  saw  in  this  dance  can  be  learn[ed]  in  an  interesting way. It may be difficult for my classmates to understand  our Indian dance, so other dance is better (10).    Here,  the  student  seeks  an  alternate  medium  to  learn  Math.  This  student  seems  to  suggest  that  math  learning  should  be  done  in  a  fun way and not by using monotonous methods.  This writer is able  to recognize that there are other ways of learning math. He is also  able  to  articulate  the  different  ways  dance  engages  him.  This  is  a  concrete operational concept.      Formal operational    Due  to  the  fact  that  I  started  learning  Bharatanatyam  in  the  fifth  grade, I had already learned the basic concepts of math. However,  dance  helped  reinforce  many  of  the  concepts  I  had  learned  and  even strengthened my math skills. Such as the music that goes with  the  common  jathis, learning  to  count  the  beats  in  threes  and  fours  helped  with  multiplication  skills.  In  regards  to  geometry,  math  actually  helped  me  become  a  better  dancer.  Bharatanatyam  is  about  having  straight  lines.  So  when  it  came  to  having  a  good  posture, I would look in a mirror and make my arms 180 degrees or  make  sure  my  poses  looked  straight  like  the  shapes  that  we  learned in school (6).     This is an advanced concept that can be understood by a student  who  has  strong  knowledge  of  both  the  disciplines  of  math  and  dance. The writer is able to articulate how skill sets acquired in one  discipline   is   helpful   in  another  domain  if  the  proficiencies  are               complimentary to each other. The writer’s comparison to 180 degree  and the poses she dances to can be perfected with the figures she  learns  at  school  is  an  example  of  integrated  learning  that  Noweck  (2011) discusses.     Being  able  to  relate  that  aramandi  is  a  diamond  or  that  hand[s]  joined  together to say namaste form an isosceles triangle can help  students grasp the   different shapes and their abilities to transform  much  easier  more  so  than  when  it  is  just  a  theory  on  a  piece  of  paper.  Since  I  am  a  very  hand[s]  on  learner,  dance  has  definitely  helped reinforce those concepts (7).    This  dancer  has  the  ability  to  compare  the  figures  accurately  with  the  dance  poses  she  performs.  The  writer  also  acknowledges  that  she  is  a  kinesthetic  learner  so  dance  has  helped  her  to  visualize  diamond  and  isosceles triangle.  This  may  be  a  call  for  teachers  to  use different methods while teaching geometrical shapes.    Dance  is  an  art  form  that  strengthens  the  mind  through  repetition  and  concentration.  In  regards  to  teaching  math  concepts,  many  basic  concepts  of  geometry  found  in  the  mudras  and  stances  are  repeated  over  and  over  in  multiple  dances  so  it  gets  better  ingrained in the mind. The more someone is exposed to something  the  easier  it  is  to  remember  and  later  understand,  as  is the  case  I  found for myself in math (15).    The  above  description  deals  with  the  student’s  focus  on  the  retention  aspect.  Both  math  and  dance  require  practice  and  repetitive working-out of problems and watching and performing the  formations respectively. This writer is able to recognize the different  shapes formed in different mudras or poses in Bharatanatyam.    The  following  table  explains  the  first  two  steps  involved  in  categorical analysis process of data. The texts from the participants  are  classified  using  Piaget’s  stages  of  cognitive  development  and  the  researcher  has  recorded  her  the  participants’  interpretations  of  school  practices  and  knowledge  transfer (Table 3).   inferences  based  on   including   The  only  computation  this  study  uses  is  the  number  of  times  each  participant  identifies  a  geometric shape  in  the  dance.  Five  of  the  participants  listed  all  of  the  shapes  from  simple  to  complex.  However,  five  of  the  writers  recorded  rectangle  as  parallelogram.  Only  five  were  able  to  identify  the  shapes  in  the  concrete  operational  level  and  five  could  do  the  formal  operational  thinking  by  trapezoid,  diamond,  acute  and  obtuse  angles,  rhombus,  and  hexagon.  Next,  I  tallied  the  geometrical  shapes  by  recording  all  of  them.  Out  of  the  total  twenty  participants,  I  was  interested in finding out how many participants recognized all of the  shapes.       FINDINGS    It  was  clear  that  students  appreciated the integration of math and dance in learning  the  basic  geometric  shapes.  Students  recognized  the  value  of  incorporating  a  cultural  out-of-school  activity  to  learn a content area (math) because these children were  able  to  recognize  the  connection  between  the  skill  set  common to math and dance. Several participants pointed  out  how  teaching  styles  did  not  match  with  the  learning  needs  of  students,  especially  those  who  were  experienced  with  culturally  contextualized  dance  called  Bharatnatyam.  The  study also enabled the researcher to    through  data  analysis              Kalpana           13   Table 3. Phrases and classification.

Along  with  traditional  methods  of  learning  math, Asian Indian children expressed their willingness to  learn  geometric  shapes  through  math  and  dance  integration.  This  integration  was  possible  through  socio- cultural  learning  (Vygotsky,  1978),  multiple  intelligences  (Gardner  1999),  and  integrative  learning  (Nowcek  2011;  Zuckerbros, 2011).        Conclusion    A  preliminary  inquiry  of  Bharatnatyam  students’  percep- tion of integrating mathematics and dance suggested that  Asian Indian American students could learn math through  culturally  specific  dance  called  Bharatnatyam.  The  participants  described  their  willingness  to  learn  through  transmediation  and  not  merely  through  linguistic  modes  of  instruction.  The  study  also  revealed  how  Asian  Indian  students  through  Bharatanatyam.  According  the  study  participants,  it  is  easier  to  visualize  than  just  listen  to  material presented to her,     “ Being able to relate that aramandi  is a diamond or that  hand[s] joined together to say namaste form an isosceles  triangle can help students grasp the different shapes and  their  abilities  to  transform  much  easier  more  so  than  when it is just a theory on a piece of paper. Since I am a  very  hand[s]  on  learner,  dance  has  definitely  helped  reinforce those concepts” (15).      Biases    This study  was  conducted  out  of  school  with  students    reiterate  math   to  one  of   concepts   can      the   have   deep   firsthand   knowledge   from  one  cultural  group  that  is  marginalized  in  the  US.  This may create some biases in the participant selection,  which  may  differentiate  them  from  their  classmates  at  school.  The  following  biases  are  noteworthy-  (a)  The  participants  have  parental  and  community  support  when  they  perform  and  they  are  provided  with  the  tools  necessary  for  success.  (b)  The  participants’  parents  are  either  professionals  or  have  successful  careers.  Parents  take their children to dance class for cultural preservation.  (c)  Most  of  the  participants  dance  or  watch their  siblings  and friends dance. (d) This current study favors students  who  of  Bharatanatyam and they may have approached the study  with  a  fair  knowledge  of  the  dance.  In  addition,  Asian  Indian students have a reputation of excelling in Science  Technology  Engineering  Mathematics  (STEM)  fields.  Therefore,  this  study’s  findings  cannot  be  generalized,  but  the  study  may  be  informative  to  researchers  and  teachers  interested  in  the  integration  of  dance  and  math  disciplines.       IMPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS    The  integration  of  math  and dance  encourages  teachers  to  rethink  their  approaches  to  teaching  content  area  (geometry)  utilizing  aesthetics  (dance),  especially  for  those  students  who  engage  in  out-of-school  cultural  art  activity. Schools should consider investigating a variety of  ways  how  culturally  relevant  practices  such  as  Bharatnatyam  could  be  exploited  so  diverse  students  including  Indian  American  can  benefit.  According  to  Moore  and  Linder  (2012,  108),  “…the  arts  are  inherently  connected to other  domains  of  knowledge  and  therefore  are  disconnected  at  the  expense  of  the  intimacy  between  the  arts  and  other  domains.”  The  combination of   Bharatanatyam   concepts   that  support    the  Asian      14            J. Studio Fine Art           Figure 2. Mathematics and Bharatnatyam.         math  concepts  as  described  through  the  analysis  of  the  data  in  this  study  help  with  understanding  of  the  integration  of  dance  and  math  as  informative  and  perceptive.  Students  who  are  bodily-kinesthetic,  visual,  and logical learners are able to master concepts or skills  common  to  math  and  dance.  Dancers  must  become  proficient  with  patterns  and  different  stage  formations  while  performing  and  students  of  mathematics  must  master  skill  set  used  in  problem  solving  such  as  congruence,  symmetry,  shapes,  and  angles.  The  following figure depicts the relationship between  learning  styles in math and dance (Figure 2).    The  limitations  of  the  study  are  –  (a)  few  participants,  (b)  the  use  of  Bharatnatyam  and  no  other  dance  styles,  (c)  the  study’s  duration,  and  (d)  sequential  mixed  methods  analysis  design.  A  follow  up  study  with  more  number  of  participants  will  yield  better  results.  Other  dance forms such as Flamenco, Hip-hop, and Ballet may  be  considered  for  comparison  because  the  study  was  conducted in the US. This study was done within a short  period of time and studying students engaged in learning  math utilizing dance for a longer duration would also help  in  understanding  the  learning  processes.  Finally,  a  quantitative  analysis  of  data  with  control  groups  may  provide improved results.       Conflict of Interests    The authors have not declared any conflict of interests.

They cannot clarify anything about this research project, so please direct all  your inquiries to Dr. Iyengar.    Title of the Research Study: Teaching Basic Geometrical Shapes Using Bharatanatyam.    Purpose:  The  purpose  is  to  investigate  and  conduct  a  mixed  methods  research  study  to  answer  the  following  hypothesis- Baharatanatyam is an engaging modality to teach geometric shapes because this dance accommodates the  different kinds of learners including logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, bodily/kenesthetic, and musical/rhythmical.    Goal:  The  goal  of  this  study  is  to  contribute  to  the  existing  literature  on  teaching  Math  using  dance.  Asian  Indian  American culture is not well addressed in American classrooms because of lack of awareness about the culture, lack of  access to Asian Indian literature and cultural devices, and lack of trained teachers in schools in the US. This study will  help the researcher  to explore  the  significance  of  such pedagogy  in scaffolding  Asian  Indian American  students.    The  following  questionnaire  will  be  used  to  solicit  responses  after  your  children  watch  a  5-minute  video  on  “Jathi”  By  Mrs.  Savitha  Shastry,  a  Bharatanatyam  dancer.  The  participants  will  be  asked  to  watch  a  short  video  and  answer  a  questionnaire  along  with  identifying  the  different  shapes  they  can  learn  through  Bharatnatyam.

Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030  Innovations in Contemporary Indian Dance: From Religious and Mythological Roots in Classical Bharatanatyam  Ketu H. Katrak* University of California, Irvine  Abstract Contemporary Indian Dance as a new multi-layered dance genre unfolds at the intersection of Indian classical dance and other movement vocabularies such as modern dance, yoga, martial arts, and theatre techniques. This three-part essay traces a brief history of the ‘‘revival’’ of bharatanat- yam in late 19th and early 20th century, then discusses the work of pioneers in Contemporary Indian Dance, Chandralekha, Anita Ratnam, and Hari Krishnan. Discussion includes a redeﬁnition of the sacred, use of Indian goddesses and epic stories for contemporary relevance, as well as the subverting of stereotypes of gender, culture, and nation in Contemporary Indian Dance.  Expressive arts such as music and dance in the Hindu tradition constitute integral parts of ritual worship and daily devotional practices for many worshippers in India. In particular, the history of temple dance performed by devadasis or temple dancers (discussed below) provides signiﬁcant antecedents for Contemporary Indian Dance, a new multi-layered and hybrid genre used increasingly since the 1980s in India and the diaspora (with early 20th century pioneer Uday Shankar (Chakravorty & Khokar 1984)). This new style is rooted mainly in two of the eight classical Indian dance styles, bharatanatym and kathak.1 This essay presents an innovative intervention in Religious Studies via my analysis of selected Contemporary Indian dancers’ choreography and their reinterpretations of tradi- tional Indian religious and mythological stories. Further, my critical analysis of these artists’ contemporary choreography using abstract movement versus narrative, deploying the body as a sacred space brings illuminations to scholars of Religion.  In this essay, I analyze the work (1970s to early 2000) of the late pioneer Chandralekha whom I describe as a foremother of Contemporary Indian Dance. Contemporary Indian dancers like Chandralekha may adopt a secular emphasis via abstract movement rather than classical Indian dances’ traditional use of religious and epic stories from the promi- nent Indian epics, The Ramayana, and The Mahabharata. Chandra (as she was commonly called) rejected the religious iconography of classical bharatanatyam as well as stories from myths and epics. Rather, she deployed deeply resonant abstract movement and martial arts executed by the body. Chandra’s focus on the physical body itself as a sacred space, a vehicle (as in yoga) to reach a higher realm, embodies a commingling of the sensual and spiritual that is an integral part of Indian aesthetics and philosophical systems.  I also discuss two other Contemporary Indian dancers who collaborate transnationally– Chennai-based Anita Ratnam and Toronto-based Hari Krishnan – who reinvent religious icons and mythical stories giving them contemporary, gendered, even feminist relevance. Their re-interpretations of traditional myths and epic stories are rendered often via abstract movement (demonstrating Chandra’s inﬂuence, subtle if not overt). Ratnam, dif- ferently from Chandra, recuperates the representation of religious icons especially goddess  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd   48 Ketu Katrak  ﬁgures in her choreography. However, these female divinities embody a unique kind of sacredness (different from traditional bhakti, i.e. devotion expressed in classical bharatanat- yam) that Ratnam delineates as the ‘‘feminine transcendental’’ (discussed below) relevant for contemporary women, even feminists among today’s artists, spectators and the general community. As she remarks:  The strength of the spiritual and the inspiration of the mythological are undeniable. Mythology is not outside of us and part of some distant past. Divinities and heroes come into our homes. … So when I dance and tune into those kinds of stories and images, I only use them as spring- boards and keep asking myself, ‘What do I have to say as a dancer, today?’ Anita Ratnam (2010)  The following discussion proceeds as follows: (1) a brief introduction to Contemporary Indian Dance and its use of religious icons and hybrid movement vocabularies; (2) the contested history of the ‘‘revival’’ of bharatanatyam in late 19th and early 20th centu- ries; (3) Chandralekha’s abstract innovations where the body itself is sacred; and (4) Anita Ratnam and Hari Krishnan’s contemporary engagement with goddesses and epic stories.  Introduction to Contemporary Indian Dance  India’s rich heritage of dance and music has a long history with impact of royal families and patrons of the arts in pre-British colonial times, followed by British colonialism (mid-18th century onwards), then into the postcolonial era (after India’s independence from the British in 1947) and contemporary 21st century. Bharatanatyam’s movement vocabulary constituted of nrtta (abstract foot-work), mudras (hand gestures), and abhinaya (gesture language, facial and bodily) along with its roots in Hindu religion, mythology, and the two major Indian epics that often inspire Contemporary Indian dancers who are trained often in one or other of the classical dance styles.  Most commonly, bharatanatyam and kathak based dancers create Contemporary Indian dance – a vibrant form that unfolds at the intersection of classical Indian dance with other movement vocabularies from an Indian and a global sensibility – yoga, martial arts, mod- ern, postmodern dance, ballet, hip-hop, theatrical elements, and jazz – inﬂuenced, since the 1990s by globalization and the internet. Contemporary idioms unfold at the intersection of classical and modern, old and new (see Katrak 2011).  Hybrid choreography uses Indian dance mudras for abstract contemporary dance, or gives modern re-interpretations to Indian epic and mythological stories. Contemporary Indian dancers may evoke the religious base of classical bharatanatyam even as they re-invent, in tune with today’s concerns with gender and sexuality, ethnicity and nation- ality, notions of bhakti (devotion) and mythic-religious ﬁgures in ways markedly different from early 20th century artists when nationalism and anti-colonial rhetoric directed the recuperation and celebration of classical Indian dance.  Today, Contemporary Indian dance is practiced globally with artists such as Mumbai- based Astad Deboo, awarded the Indian government’s Padma Shri for his pioneering con- tributions to this style, Chennai-based Anita Ratnam, Trivandrum-based Daksha Sheth, Delhi-based Aditi Mangaldas, Ahmedabad-based Mallika Sarabhai, and other artists in the global diaspora such as London-based Shobana Jeyasingh, Akram Khan, Toronto-based Hari Krishnan, Lata Pada, Ottawa-based Natasha Bakht, Los Angeles-based Sheetal Gandhi, the Post Natyam Collective, among others.  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   Innovations of Classical Bharatanatyam 49  Multiple Contestations of Bharatanatyam’s ‘‘Revival’’  The ‘‘stories’’ from late 19th and early 20th centuries about bharatnatyam’s ‘‘rebirth’’ come from many players–colonialist-Orientalists, nationalists, and Brahmins – with differ- ent socio-cultural and political agendas in ‘‘classicizing’’ Indian arts. A key paradox lies at the heart of these versions: social reformers and revivalists engaged simultaneously in both the prohibition and rescue of the very same art form. Moralistic reformers wished to eradicate, even through legislation, the institution of devadasis (temple dancers) dedicated to temples in Southern India as though they were all prostitutes.2 Some of them were forced into prostitution for survival when patronage for the devadasis decreased.  The devadasi dance called sadir or dasiattam in devotional expression of sringara (love) for the temple deity uniquely brought together the spiritual with the sensual, even erotic that was often misunderstood both by moralistic Victorian British colonizers and by Indian elites who judged the devadasis’ life-style as disreputable. Ironically, the same revivalists who wanted to wipe out the devadasi dance tradition simultaneously wanted to salvage the art in a form ‘‘respectable’’ to them as in renaming sadir as bharatanatyam. Neither colonizers nor Indian reformers wished to recognize that devadasis belonged to hereditary communities of artists who excelled in dance and music. Ignoring the speciﬁc history and location of sadir, they invented and ascribed notions of ‘‘purity,’’ ‘‘classicism,’’ and ‘‘ancientness’’ to the ‘‘new’’ dance form. Avanthi Meduri’s essay, ‘‘Bharata Natyam – What are You?’’ usefully notes that for hereditary devadasi artists, dance ‘‘was a living tradition that fused belief with practice’’ Meduri (1988). When the reformers ‘‘elevated’’ the dance’s status by having ‘‘respectable’’ families take it over, the devadasi herself was ‘‘rudely dismissed, while the dance itself, like the mythical phoenix’’ remarks Meduri, ‘‘rose from the ashes.’’  In recuperating traditional dance, revivalist zeal was fuelled by the prevalent British colonial climate of the late 19th century that judged most aspects of Indian culture and religion as backward, driven by superstition and blind faith. This partly inﬂuenced social reformers to counter colonizers’ ignorance to demonstrate a new form of Indian moder- nity rooted in ancient, even timeless Indian culture distinct from western modernity. This endeavor to invent, even ‘‘culturally engineer’’ an Indian past within which classical Indian dance belonged was part of a complex process undertaken mostly by upper-caste Brahmins and other educated elites; effectively, they marginalized sadir’s actual commu- nity of practitioners (Allen 1997; Coorlawala 1996; O’Shea 1988, 2007). ‘‘The genealogy of the classical in modernity and its location in the spiritualized inner realm of the indige- nous,’’ remark Indira Viswanathan Petereson and Davesh Soneji in an excellent revision- ary history ‘‘suggest why upper-caste elites and middle-class nationalists became the chief engineers of the classicization of indigenous dance and music in both northern and south- ern India.’’3  Whereas traditional practitioners once practiced their art in temples and courts, and had mobility between these spaces, the practitioners of the new ‘‘high’’ art now per- formed on the proscenium stage. This new, modern form of traditional dance had to pro- ject itself as ‘‘simultaneously traditional and modern’’ (Performing Pasts, 7).  In the late 18th century, the Maratha courts of Thanjavur (in Tamil Nadu) fostered inﬂuences.4 the development of music and dance with varying regional and external Much of the future destiny of the ‘‘classical’’ traditions like bharatanatyam and Carnatic music were forged in the city of Madras (now called Chennai), the capital of the British Madras Presidency.5  One key player in bharatanatyam’s ‘‘revival’’ was Rukmini Devi Arundale who institu- tionalized bharatanatyam with her establishment of Kalakshetra Dance Academy in 1936  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   50 Ketu Katrak  (see Meduri, 2005, Samson 2010). Devi ‘‘puriﬁed’’ sadir-cum-bharatanatyam and replaced sensuality with religious emphasis in the dance’s overall affect. This raised objections, especially regarding the representation of sringara (love in various manifestations – as mother, lover, devotee) from one of the legendary dancers, T. Balasaraswati (often called Bala) who belonged to a devadasi family. She stated: ‘‘the shringara [sic] we experience in bharata natyam is never carnal – never, never. For those who have yielded themselves to this discipline with total dedication, dance like music is the practice of presence, it cannot merely be the body’s rapture.’’ (Pattabhi Raman & Ramachandran 1984) Bala asserted forthrightly: ‘‘there is nothing in Bharatha Natyam which can be puriﬁed afresh; it is divine and is innately so.’’ Janet O’Shea explains that Bala ‘‘argued for an untainted erotic-aesthetic-sacred continuum as the heritage of the devadasi dance, and one not to be confused with a vulgar eroticism’’ (Quoted in Performing Pasts, 18). Bala in her turn described this ‘‘Brahminized’’ dance as ‘‘vulgar.’’ These divergent views are part of bharatanatyam’s history and evolution (Balasaraswati 1988).  Even as individuals like Devi were successful in institutionalizing bharatanatyam, many hereditary practitioners were marginalized. A great talent like Balasaraswati, although she performed and taught in Madras (1940s-50s), was soon to devote her energies to teaching outside India, mainly in the U.S. (Cowdery 1995)  Chandralekha: A Pioneering Foremother of Contemporary Indian Dance  In her wholly original choreography (1970s-early 2000s), the late Chandralekha who had trained in bharatanatyam, rejected what she regarded as its superﬁcial religiosity and emphasis on the overly decorated dancer in silk sari and jewelry. She elected to work with abstract movement and Indian martial arts, regarding the vehicle of the physical body, especially the spine that she spoke about as central, as a precious resource not only for performance but as much for a balanced life. Through the body’s ability to assume abstract geometrical positions that she created in movement, she brought together physi- cal sensuality and inner connectedness of the body, mind and spirit as in yoga. Chandra’s many works began with Angika (1985) and ended with Sharira (2001) – both translate as ‘‘body.’’ Sharira ‘‘celebrates the living body in which sexuality, sensuality and spirituality co-exist’’ is an accurate description of Sharira. (Menon nd)  ‘‘Body corporeal and body conceptual’’  (Program Notes).  Uniquely, Chandra relied only on Indian movement and martial arts traditions, aesthet- ics and philosophy, what scholar Rustom Bharucha calls the ‘‘Indian psychophysical tradi- tion’’ that served as her ‘‘primary point of reference.’’(Bharucha 1995, 2009). This was unlike Contemporary Indian Dancers today who use many movement styles, Indian and Western. Chandra’s innovations remain profoundly inﬂuential for today’s artists, including her collaborative spirit that enabled her to work with dancer-choreographers, musicians, visual artists and poets – this was not as common in the 1970s as it is today.  Along with rejecting bharatanatyam’s religious representations, Chandra also moved away from bharatanatyam’s mythological and narrative bases relying on nayikas (heroines) pining for the nayakas (heroes) expressed in the gesture language of abhinaya. Her non- narrative, abstract work is fully absorbing, not distant and cold, contrary to the charge that her performances lacked rasa (emotion). Chandra ‘‘demonstrated that rasa need not be yoked to narrative alone, but it can be evoked at more abstract levels’’ (Bharucha, Chandralekha: Woman…). Indeed, Chandra’s insightful separation of rasa from narrative is path breaking as its legacy continues today in Contemporary choreography like Astad Deboo’s, or Shobana Jeyasingh’s who evoke rasa via abstract dance.  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   Innovations of Classical Bharatanatyam 51  Chandra’s move away from bharatanatyam’s reliance on myth and narrative also enabled her to connect dance and life: ‘‘The internal relation between the dance and the dancer’’ she remarked, ‘‘and the external relation between dance and society are questions that cannot be taken lightly.’’ (Chandralekha 1984) Today’s Contemporary Indian Danc- ers create works about their social realities such as domestic and communal violence, and gender inequities.  in terms of patriarchal and Brahmanical premises’’  Chandra reﬂected and built upon, critiqued, dismantled and restructured from within the forms of bharatanatyam and kalari martial arts. She realized that she must not only reinvent bharatanatyam from the inside but also the very ‘‘ideological base [of bharatanat- yam] (Bharucha, Chandralekha: Woman…) The goal of making tradition itself modern was a life-long process expressed in Chandra’s many choreographic works. Her work demonstrated ‘‘how Indian dance can be modern on its own terms without borrowing from the West’’ (Program Notes, Sharira, New Delhi, 2009). Many Contemporary Indian dancers reﬂect this sentiment.  As Chandra worked with and departed from ‘‘the exclusive classicism of Bharata  Natyam,’’ she faced many questions:  how to explore, expand, universalize the form; how to comprehend its inherent energy con- tent; how to see it in relation to other allied physical disciplines in India – like yoga, ancient martial arts … how to interpret the purity of Bharata Natyam; its body geometry of squares, circles, triangles, coils, curves; how to visualize this body-geometry in terms of space-geometry … how to slash across the dead weight of the ‘past’ suffocating dance in the name of ‘tradi- tion’; how to pare dance of its feudal and religious acculturations … how to consolidate the conjunctions between our (Chandra, Reﬂections…57–58)  forms and our contemporary concerns.  traditional  Chandra’s signiﬁcant innovations have become iconic as they echo in the work of contemporary Indian dancers: minimalist and slowly unfolding movement, even a medita- tive quality is a signature of Contemporary Indian Dancers such as Anita Ratnam among others; abstract concepts rendered in dance by Aditi Mangaldas’s choreography in Time- less, Lata Pada’s shunya (zero⁄ silence), Anita Ratnam’s 7 graces; nrtta with rasa in Astad De- boo’s ContraPosition, in Akram Khan’s zero degrees; inventive use of solkettu (syllables used in Indian dance movement) not for nrtta (foot-work) but for abhinaya (gesture language) in Hari Krishnan’s Owning Shadows; choreographic explorations of the human body in Natasha Bakht’s White Space. Chandra’s bold representations of the sexual, sensual and spiritual co-existing resonate among the Post Natyam Collective.  Chandra’s work was bold though she was not bothered about creating something ‘‘contemporary.’’ Taking risks without worrying about the outcome was her method–this may be one of the true meanings of dancing on the edge. Her contributions are monu- mental for Contemporary Indian dancers; her genius gave new bodily meanings to abstract concepts of time and space, sensuality, sexuality and spirituality.  Transnational Collaborations: Anita Ratnam and Hari Krishnan  Chandra’s unique inventions of Indian dance from within, her use of abstract movement aligning the body’s sensual and spiritual capacities are continued and taken further artisti- cally and across national borders in collaborations between Chennai-based Anita Ratnam, and Toronto-based Hari Krishnan, both trained in bharatanatyam.  Ratnam is remarkably multi-talented – dancer-choreographer, cultural commentator, producer, presenter, publisher, and writer. I describe her as an ethno-global artist – as  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   52 Ketu Katrak  one who is ﬁrmly grounded in her own Tamil and pan-Indian cultural, social, religious ambience along with global openness in artistic work (Katrak 2009). Prior to her Con- temporary choreography, Ratnam was a well-received solo bharatanatyam performer before she left her hometown of Chennai for New York City after marriage. During 10 years (1980–1990) there, she worked as a television commentator, and a successful producer of TV shows like the Festival of India among others. While in New York, Ratnam stayed away from dance and when she returned to India she did not want to return to the solo performance circuit. Rather, she explored other movement vocabular- ies while remaining rooted in her Tamil cultural, musical and artistic tradition. She was interested in bringing new creative energy to traditional dance forms and to undertake cross-cultural collaborations, festivals and to showcase new talent. She established Arangham Dance Company and Foundation in 1992.  Raised in Singapore, Hari Krishnan, born into a family that practiced classical Carnatic music and dance, was steeped in bharatanatyam from a young age. His bharatanatyam guru was the late Kittappa Pillai. Krishnan always asserts the modernity of bharatanatyam and its global practice today as ‘‘a signiﬁer of South Asian identity.’’ The bedrock of his creative ventures into other dance vocabularies and his adventurous collaborations remain in what he describes as ‘‘the contemporary abstractions of bharatanatyam.’’  Krishnan is the Artistic Director of InDance Company, based in Toronto since 1999, bringing together distinctly multi-ethnic dancers of South Asian, Chinese, Japanese, and Canadian origins. Krishnan also founded the Mangala Initiative, a non-proﬁt Canadian organization that offers ﬁnancial assistance to female artists in rural Tamil Nadu. Though based in Toronto, Krishnan has been Artist in Residence at Wesleyan University in the United States since 2000, where he teaches bharatanatyam and lectures ‘‘on the postcolo- nial experience’’ as he puts it, ‘‘as well as on the global contemporary manifestations of South Asian dance’’ (In Dance publicity materials).  Ratnam’s Contemporary choreography is rooted in what she calls ‘‘the feminine tran- scendental.’’ She redeﬁnes the sacred, different from traditional bharatanatyam’s bhakti (devotion). Even as she explores religious and mythological ﬁgures, they are situated ﬁrmly in her contemporary urban experience as an Indian woman and a feminist. For instance, in A Million Sita-s, she contemporizes The Ramayana’s heroine Sita; in her signa- ture piece, 7 graces, Ratnam references the Tibetan goddess of compassion, Tara, not lit- erally but through her special universal connection to the female body and femininity.  Ratnam described aptly as a ‘‘contemporary classicist’’ has evolved a signature style from what she terms the ‘‘parallel mythology’’ of Indian, Chinese, and Tibetan goddesses expressed in a variety of movement vocabularies. Ratnam calls her style of Contemporary Indian Dance ‘‘Neo-Bharatam, a form that is the synergy of all my classical and medita- tive movement techniques, ﬂavored by my life experience as an Indian woman’’ (Ratnam 2008). Neo- Bharatam retains the notion of the new along with her base in bharatanat- yam and Indian aesthetics of color, music, and affect.  Krishnan’s hybrid choreography subverts cultural, national, and gender stereotypes both seriously and humorously in works such as Recipes for Curry, Bollywood Hopscotch among others. In Owning Shadows (discussed below) Krishnan draws upon a Ramayana segment but instead of narrative, he uses abstract movement (as also in Ratnam’s 7 graces that Krishnan directed), to convey the dark side of human nature embodied in the emotions of lust and greed via the story of Surpanakha, the demoness who desires Rama urging him to leave his wife Sita.  Krishnan engages creatively with what he calls ‘‘vintage bharatanatyam’’ wherein his choreography is linked to the spiritual in his devout dedication to learning devadasi dance  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   Innovations of Classical Bharatanatyam 53  items from surviving hereditary practitioners. He has ‘‘reconstructed several vintage tem- ple and court dance genres’’ in the Thanjavur tradition, learning temple-dance repertoires from the last surviving member of the hereditary female dance community from the Tir- uvarur temple in South India (Interview with Lalitha Venkat, August 7, 2005). He is the only dancer to have inherited the entire repertoire of the Viralimalai temple tradition from R. Muttukkannammal, the last devadasi to be dedicated at the Murugan temple in Viralimalai. Krishnan’s contemporary immersion in this historical recuperation of devadasi contributions, of nattuvanars and their families, enables him to pass down this legacy to his InDance Company – beautifully showcased in June 2010 at a ‘‘SoloDance Sympo- sium’’ that he co-curated with Davesh Soneji at Toronto’s Royal Ontario Museum (ROM). It is heartening to see that some part of the devadasi repertoire is alive in the bodies of these young Canadians of Indian, Japanese, and Caucasian ancestries.  Contemporary renditions of devadasi repertoire harkens to the origins of devadasi dance. At the same time, this representation by contemporary InDance artists is different from the original devadasis since these contemporary artists do not belong to the devadasis’ hereditary community nor do they necessarily share their Hindu religious beliefs. On their modern bodies, the devadasi dances’ spirituality is decoded by evoking a contempo- rary sensibility that inhabits spirituality differently than devadasis of a previous era. Such evocation of a different time and space into modern, urban Toronto provides the audi- ence with a unique ﬂavor of a spiritual (though not necessarily Hindu) mixed with a con- temporary multi-ethnic ﬂavor. Here, in our common sharing of human breath (as in yoga), and universal human emotions such as love, fear, among others (described in the ancient text, The Natyasastra as the navarasas, i.e. the nine primary human emotions) come to the fore.  indeed, a universalized spirituality, as  Krishnan’s and Ratnam’s personal histories and over 30 year dance careers have brought them to an artistic place where they collaborate transnationally between Chennai and Toronto, or London (where Krishnan serves as mentor during summer workshops, ‘‘Unlocking Creativity’’ by the South Asian organization Kadam). Transcending national borders and different regions within the nation (such as urban to rural) is not only geo- graphical for these artists; they also cross boundaries of traditional Indian dance forms transforming them from within. A creative commingling of local and global is found in their artistry. Ratnam, rooted in her indigenous Tamil context with ancestral links to her family village in Tirukurungudi, where she has revived a 13th century ritual theatre called Kaisika Natanam (Ratnam 2000). This 5-hour performance tells the story of a lowborn devotee called Nambaduvan who travels to the entrance of the Vishnu shrine and though he cannot enter given his low caste, he can sing in adoration of the Lord. A demon intercepts his journey, threatens to devour him and is later transformed by the devotion of Nambuduvan’s music. The demon is blessed and regains his normal human shape. The story underlines the power of music and the force of single-minded devotion.  While both Ratnam and Krishnan retain a deep resonance of bharatanatyam in their work, they bring a unique contemporary sensibility to their hybrid dance language of Contemporary Indian Dance, namely, transforming bharatanatyam from within, creating inventive palimpsests of movement vocabularies from India and the West, and fashioning striking visual, spatial, facial (bold refashioning of traditional abhinaya, or using nrtta rather than lyric poetry as in traditional bharatanatyam to convey emotion) and aural effects. Their creative choreography is marked by their bold deployment of hybridity in move- ment vocabularies including minimalism, challenging stereotypes of gender and sexuality, and collaborating across national boundaries. Their creative work is illuminated via theo- rization of the concepts of hybridity, modernity, and transnational feminism.  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   54 Ketu Katrak  Ratnam’s reinterpretation of the sacred, drawing energy from Indian female goddess tradi- tions that are recuperated uniquely is the cornerstone of her contributions to Contempo- rary Indian Dance. The sacred in her hands transcends narrow religious and regional frameworks to touch humanity in any culture, bearing a meditative quality, a yoga-like life-energy that links human beings even through the commonality of the breath. This sacred feeling is also part of our collective unconscious in the Jungian sense. While uni- versal, Ratnam also grounds the sacred for herself in the local, regional, and ritual tradi- tions of her Tamil heritage without narrowly limiting it.  The sacred is accompanied often in many traditions, and certainly in India, with the sensual as expressed via color, decoration, and the fragrance of ﬂowers or incense. Hence, even as Ratnam’s interpretation of the sacred steps away from narrow religiosity, she evokes an Indian aesthetic resonance in her bold and careful embrace of aharya (decora- tion) in her contemporary dance. She does not reject color and ornamentation as some Contemporary Indian Dancers do, drawing attention only to the body. But Ratnam delights in the sensuality of the spiritual, part of Indian aesthetic tradition.  Ratnam brings her own unique perspective on tradition, seeking the in-between spaces and deliberate breaks of movement in order to work against what she calls ‘‘a closure’’ in classical bharatanatyam, and embodies hybridity in her work. Ratnam’s engagement with tradition includes liturgical Tamil poetry, along with a vibrant contemporaneity.  incorporating ritual,  Ratnam is recognized for ‘‘redeﬁning bharatanatyam as a global style – a transcultural experience’’ (The Hindu, May 22, 2000). ‘‘I was always drawn to the idea of turning Bha- ratanatyam on its head,’’ she remarks. ‘‘My larger agenda is to create a new audience, a younger audience for Indian dance. I fear we are losing an audience who is alienated and intimidated by its formalism’’ (The Hindu, September 26, 2002).  Ratnam’s art has a distinctively female, even feminist thrust. Her notion of the ‘‘female transcendental’’ reaches into a global feminist consciousness that remains cognizant of gen- der inequality even as it reaches for a speciﬁcally female spiritual quality, such as in her choreography about female mystic poet-saints such as Meera or Andaal. In such works, Ratnam contributes uniquely to the evolving language of Contemporary Indian dance.  Ratnam’s Contemporary Indian Dance since the 1990s redeﬁnes the sacred making it relevant for our times, enabling viewers to differentiate between sacredness and religiosity. External manifestations via statues of deities, incense, and ﬂowers are not part of Ratnam’s idea of the sacred; rather, she evokes the divine within each individual and draws her audience into connecting with this sentiment in their own personal ways, inviting them to move into an inner quiet space as they lose awareness of their mundane everyday lives and attempt sacred becomes personal, female, familial, even reaching towards a wider humanity that touches diverse audiences with varied beliefs of the sacred or even none at all.  to transcend their limited egos. This concept of  The coming together of sacredness and faith, faith and thought, belief and discourse, while seemingly paradoxical, works congruently within Indian aesthetics. Ratnam embraces bhakti (devotion equally for a deity as for a lover or a child) as sacred, thought- based, and thought provocative rather than a sense of blind devotion. Ratnam explores Indian Tantric philosophy and its delineation of chakras in the human body in Adhirohana (The Ascent, 1998) where she evokes how human energy moves from the kundalini energy at the base of the spine to the shirsasana chakra at the top of the head. In this piece, as in another more recent work, Neelam (2006), Ratnam uses mandalas that invigorate geomet- rical patterns with sacred connotations. On stage, she uses square stools, and other shapes such as triangles to invoke energy that comes through mandalas.  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   Innovations of Classical Bharatanatyam 55  Ratnam’s linking of spirituality with the female archetype (goddess, mystic) is repre- sented in her dance work, Naachiyaar (2001) that began her crossing the borders of differ- ent mythological and goddess traditions. Naachiyaar retells the story of the ninth-century female mystic poet Andaal whose passion for Krishna is expressed sensually in the famous ten verses addressed to the conch that Krishna’s sweet lips have touched. In one of the verses, Ratnam portrays Andaal’s physical and spiritual anguish as she addresses the conch that was blessed by Krishna’s lips. Andaal asks the conch, how do Krishna’s lips smell? Do they have the fragrance of camphor or lotus? The ﬁnal segment culminates in an explicit sexual fantasy of a bridal procession and its group of dancers. In order to visually narrate this dream, Ratnam converts a long, unstitched piece of fabric into a ﬂute, a gar- land, and a conch (The Statesman, May 9, 2003). The erotic sensuality coalesces with the spiritual.  The goddess motif reappears in subsequent works: Devi, and Utpala (2004). In 7 Graces (2005), Ratnam draws subtly on compassionate goddess Tara as a reference point rather than literally, to suggest female energy of the womb and the pain of childbirth. The dance offers numerous conﬁgurations of the mystical number ‘‘7’’ along with the navara- sas that Ratnam dramatizes vividly on her face along with Buddhist liturgical hand mudras, Tibetan gongs, and Carnatic vocals mingled with Western style piano.  Ratnam balances motion with stillness and silence in Daughters of the Ocean, and her work after this increasingly plays with silence. Audiences used to traditional Indian dance are very uncomfortable with pin-drop silence. Ratnam believes that this piece delineates ‘‘a style of performance art for the Indian context, unique to the modern Indian experience.’’  Another collaborative work between Ratnam and Krishnan provocatively entitled, Ma3Ka continues an exploration of the sacred, drawing upon goddess icons in Ratnam’s unique way via the female goddess and ‘‘female imagery’’ (Swaminathan 2009). ‘‘Dance is my attempt to populate my world with interesting women. Some of them are those we recognize as goddesses,’’ notes Ratnam. ‘‘They have mischief, rage, anger, they can kill, protect, laugh, they have sensual power. They are I hope enigmatic, complete, intelligent and passionate’’ (Kreisberger 2010). Ratnam’s choreography intertwines the spiritual and sensual, even representing the sensual in the spiritual; sensuality encom- passes everything that appeals to the ﬁve senses and physical sex is only one expression of this.  Ma3Ka represents the trinity of Indian goddesses, Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Meenakshi, as well as the women in Anita’s family – her 97-year-old grandmother, her late mother, and her daughter in her 20’s. Anita dances within a triangle drawn on stage and the con- cept of the number three pervades the work. The costume designer Rex comments: ‘‘the nuanced interpretations and abstractions are sewn into the fabric of the work.’’ The Lakshmi section features a sequence of runway model walks, as Anita paces through various personas she has held during her life – model, stage actor, and ﬁlm personality. The work has a rich visual design that connects the ‘‘ancient, modern, timeless, speciﬁc.’’ For an ethno-global artist such as Ratnam, both feeling and thought underlie the sacred. Ratnam concerns herself less with authenticity in a particular ritualistic practice than she does with a personal, hybrid spirituality, where the collaging of different reli- gious traditions animate her dancing body on stage. Ratnam seeks ananda, when the human soul even ﬂeetingly tastes the nectar of the divine, or at the very least, a transcen- dent feeling beyond the human, that heightened aesthetic experience that can spark divine joy. Ratnam seeks this effect through stillness and silence, the yogic qualities of sthira (calm strength) and sukha (gentle softness) in her choreography.  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   56 Ketu Katrak  Like Ratnam, Hari Krishnan’s art, described as ‘‘holistic,’’ combines bharatanatyam’s vocabulary and music with ‘‘contemporary, urban, post-modern culture,’’ as Lalitha Venkat notes (narthaki.com, 7 August 2005). ‘‘What really interests Krishnan,’’ remarks Here and Now’s commentator ‘‘is the world we live in today and the possibilities for taking an ancient dance tradition and giving it contemporary relevance, even making it a way to comment on the very notion of cultural identity’’ (Crabb 2007). In a dance work provocatively entitled Recipes for Curry, Krishnan ‘‘uses contemporary styles of Bharatanat- yam,’’ notes Crabb, ‘‘in an almost subversive way to illustrate perceptions of race, culture, and heritage.’’ This challenging approach is evident in much of Krishnan’s choreography. In the duet he performed with Allan Kaeja in Yogurt and Venom, a work that he calls a ‘‘multilingual dialect,’’ he notes: ‘‘it’s like we are creating a hybrid space, something that combines contact improvisation and Bharatanatyam’’ (Sumi 2007).  Krishnan’s signature style of Contemporary Indian Dance is distinctly hybrid, evoking that no one dance style or culture is totally pure or authentic; every culture (even if not overtly colonized) has elements of being mixed, with different inﬂuences having an impact on identity formations.  Among Krishnan’s many choreographed works Owning Shadows is inspired by the dem- oness Surpanakha’s story in The Ramayana where she lusts for Rama. Krishnan abstracts from Surpanakha’s lust to explore the seamy side of human nature leaving much to the audience’s imagination. A non-narrative, abstract movement style evokes universal reso- nances of human desire, lust and greed. Indeed, Krishnan acknowledges, even ‘‘owns’’ the dark side of human nature, as the title suggests. He demonstrates the abstract notion of good and evil as co-existing in each individual by making the two bodies on stage move at times back to back as if to portray one body. At times, they split apart as they enact one emotion or another.  Surpanakha, the ten-headed demon Ravana’s sister is a crucial catalyst in the epic since love, dismisses it as lust, teases her, and with his when Rama spurns this demoness’ brother Lakshmana’s help cuts off her nose, Surpanakha reports this humiliation to Ravana who then abducts Sita. In Owning Shadows, Surpanakha’s externalized lust evokes Sita’s internalized, undemonstrated desire. Even as Sita rejects that ugly side, it is a part of her. By the same token, even the demoness feels love for Rama, however incongruous. Arshia Sattar, in a recent volume entitled, In Search of Sita: Revisiting Mythology, argues: ‘‘Sita and Surpanakha exemplify two types of women who appear almost universally in folklore and mythology. Sita is good, pure, light, auspicious and subordinate, whereas Surpanakha is evil, impure, dark, inauspicious and insubordinate. Although male charac- ters can also be divided into the good and the bad, the split between women characters is far more pronounced and is always expressed in terms of sexuality’’ (Sattar 2009).  In conclusion, the contemporary choreography of Chandralekha, Ratnam, and Krish- nan drawing upon the body’s potential for abstract and hybrid movement, along with reinterpretations of well-known Indian epic stories and goddess tales brings fresh insights not only in the ﬁeld of Contemporary Dance, but also Religious and South Asian Stud- ies. The historical ‘‘revival’’ of bharatanatyam that emphasized its spiritual over its sensual aspects as practiced in the spiritual-sensual continuum by the devadasis is recuperated via the creative imagination and choreography by artists like Anita Ratnam and Hari Krish- nan discussed here among other artists working in the genre of Contemporary Indian Dance. Re-inventing a classical dance form like bharatanatyam, placing it in conversation with Indian martial arts traditions as Chandralekha did so successfully, and in conjunction with movement vocabularies from across the globe infuses it with new creative energy that has the depth and profundity of a devotional base. Indeed, Contemporary Indian  ª 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd  Religion Compass 7/2 (2013): 47–58, 10.1111/rec3.12030   Dancers’ re-interpretations of religious icons and mythological stories make these ancient tales and goddesses speak from a bygone era to today’s audiences with deep resonance, devotion and vibrancy.

One invokes the  paranoia of what Appadurai (1996) refers to as a McDonaldization of the world, in which local  practices, identities, and economies give way to the homogenizing mandates of capitalism.  The other rejoices over the emergence of so-called hybrid cultural forms, interpreted as signs  of the resilience of non-Western societies, as harbingers of the dawn of some new age of mul-  ticultural understanding, or as proof of the political power of consumers (Garcia Canclini  1995). Both views often underestimate the complexity of the relationship between the local  and the global, and lose from view the fact that this relationship can be understood only in  terms of historical conditions operating in specific contexts.1 While capitalism plunders the  world, littering its path with Tommy Hilfiger, Pizza Hut, and the ever-popular sitcom Friends,  there are many examples of the ways in which local populations do not passively consume  what is thrown at them, but actively reinterpret and selectively combine elements of mass-  mediated culture within preexisting frameworks and markets (Diawara 1998; Feld 1988;  Martinez 1999). Moreover, the indigenization of global culture opens up the possibility of  alternative experiences of modernity, which do not fall under the rubric of American culture  but instead refer to other geocultural identities (Ching 2000).   Dance studies have tended to emphasize the more celebratory pole, looking to histories of  cultural borrowing and dance's transmigratory moves as proof of the resilience of embodied  culture. Unfortunately, such narratives can sometimes normalize globalization in ways that too  easily allow its contradictions and disparities to escape from view. Of proponents of hybridity  within studies on world music, Steven Feld writes that "celebratory narratives stress the costs  to 'tradition' as rather surface ones, ones that will, in the larger sweep of things, be overcome  by creativity, invention, and resilience" (Feld 2000, 152). Taking the case study of the Indian  classical dance, bharatanatyam, I hope to demonstrate that the globalization of local traditions  does not necessarily translate into a newly invigorated life for those practices. Moreover, it  does not imply an atmosphere of equality and mutual understanding between traditional prac-  titioners and those who make use of their teachings in other places.   Bharatanatyam, native to South India and in particular the state of Tamil Nadu, is prac-  ticed today all over the world. Rather than examine the ways in which this dance is traveling  abroad, however, I want to offer my observations about what is happening to its production 2  and performance at home in Chennai (formerly known as Madras), the capital of Tamil Nadu.  The dance form has its roots in the dasi attam performed by a special class of women attached   Shanti Pillai is a Ph.D. candidate in Performance Studies at New York University. Her  research interests include the globalization of Indian performance traditions and contempo-  rary Western perceptions about and practice of Indian spirituality and Hinduism. She began  her training in bharatanatyam under Kamala Cesar in New York and has since gone on to  study under Nandini Ramani in Chennai and Priyamvada Sankar in Montreal.   14   Dance Research Journal 34/2 (Winter 2002)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    to temples and royal courts until the "anti-nautch campaign" of the 1890s managed to all but  submerge such practices.3 In the first half of the twentieth century, a series of historical cir-  cumstances, including nationalism, a brahminization of the performing arts, and a dialogue  between Western and Indian artists, converged to bring bharatanatyam to the proscenium stage  where its performance was now acceptable for upper-caste women. The dance is thus an inter-  esting case study to consider, as its history has involved global forces for quite some time.   The fact that the concept of "globalization" is often used to cloak a process that generates  inequalities derived from differential access to markets and international cultural brokers was  on my mind one day in 2001 when I sat on the floor with a friend in her house in Chennai.  She was complaining about having to go out that evening and watch what she was sure would  be yet another lousy performance by a nonresident Indian (NRI). "These rich girls like this,"  she said acrimoniously. "They come here and dance and even if they fall on the stage every-  one will applaud them." I smiled and remembered the annual Natya Kala dance scholarship  conference I had attended only weeks earlier in Chennai. A panel of educators and dancers  from Britain had spoken with great enthusiasm about how the sons and daughters of South  Asian immigrants were taking to "traditional dances" and the energy they were bringing to  creating new ones.   The irony in juxtaposing these two viewpoints reveals some of the naive assumptions that  those who might be quick to celebrate globalization and hybridity make. First of all, cultural  forms are not simply free-floating objects that travel from point A to point B. As argued by  James Clifford, one has to consider that "practices of displacement might emerge as constitu-  tive of cultural meanings rather than as their simple transfer or extension" (Clifford 1997, 3).  At the same time, just as cultural forms travel and are translated and transformed, they then  travel back to their sites of origin, where they have consequences for the ways in which local  populations practice and consume them. Often unknown to foreign academics and artists is  that not all of the new developments are greeted with enthusiasm by local producers and audi-  ences.   Secondly, those who practice bharatanatyam outside India, in addition to those in or out   of India who are interested in innovating based on classical forms, pursue their work with ref-  erence to something they refer to as "tradition." For the former, this often means valuing the  dance as a "carrier of culture" and seeing bharatanatyam as somehow timeless and ever avail-  able for accessing an essential "Indianness." For the innovators, calling on tradition often  means claiming that bharatanatyam's static formal and thematic qualities are no longer rele-  vant to contemporary life, and therefore innovation is needed either to keep the dance alive or  to allow people to express their present-day experiences. In truth, both points of view rely on  something that is only a phantom. Although commonly conceptualized as an immobile and  untainted connection from the past, tradition is actually always thoroughly contemporary. As  Raymond Williams writes:   From a whole possible area of past and present, in a particular culture, certain  meanings and practices are selected for emphasis and certain other meanings  and practices are neglected or excluded. Yet, within a particular hegemony,  and as one of its decisive processes, this selection is presented and usually  successfully passed off as "the tradition," "the significant past." What has  then to be said about any tradition is that it is in this sense an aspect of con-   34/2 (Winter 2002) Dance Research Journal   15  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    temporary social and cultural organization, in the interest of the dominance of  a specific class. (Williams 1977, 115-116)   Thus, any tradition is the culmination of a selective process that aims to establish a historical  and cultural continuity in response to and ratifying the present order of things.   India is changing rapidly and so are all of its classical forms. It is not unusual to hear local  performers and producers voice skepticism about the forms bharatanatyam will take in the  future. While only some feel strongly that the dance is at risk of dying out, most would agree  that its practice and performance will not continue as in the past. For that matter, what one sees  today on the stage as bharatanatyam is already very different from what one saw only fifteen  years ago. In what follows I will briefly outline some of those changes as they manifest in  Chennai and what some of those involved in the performance of bharatanatyam have to say  about those changes. It would be simplistic and even xenophobic to assign blame to global  trends, as if what is taking place in India can be held as the sole responsibility of culprit NRIs  and foreign influences. Such an argument would find itself in agreement with the misguided  efforts on the part of many right-wing organizations in India and abroad to cleanse Indian cul-  ture of "outside" influences and police both artistic and intellectual production.4 In truth, India  is changing from pressures both within and from without. It is nt my intention to promote a  nostalgic vision of bharatanatyam, as it has always been a nonstatic cultural form that recre-  ated itself regularly in response to historical conditions. Moreover, some participants feel that  the dance scene today is in some ways far more alive and exciting than in the past. I hope to  demonstrate only the ways in which some contemporary changes in its production, practice,  and performance in Chennai stand at odds with the simultaneous proliferation of the dance  abroad.   Production  Shifts in how bharatanatyam gets produced in Chennai are concurrent with the dramatic  changes taking place as the Indian economy continues to privatize and interact with global  market forces. Generally speaking, money is increasingly the judge of artistic merit.  Opportunities to perform can be less dependent on skill and more on a dancer's economic  resources and social connections.   Chennai, which has historically been home to various performance organizations and halls  (sabhas), has witnessed a proliferation of cultural institutions and venues in recent years. The  chance to perform on these stages ostensibly entails submitting a resume and videotape and  competing with other dancers. As many of those involved in the performing arts readily admit,  however, it is as at least as often about getting introduced to performance organizers via a  well-known personality or business leader. For example, a successful industrialist and long-  time supporter of the arts admitted that he frequently receives calls from friends soliciting per-  formance opportunities for their daughters at any one of the venues where he has solid con-  tacts. Such a situation makes it difficult for anyone who does not hail from an elite or mon-  eyed family.   The same goes for those seeking chances to perform at one of the festivals held year-round  in cities throughout India. Such festivals, which are almost always free for the public, are an  expensive business and require ample fundraising. Travel expenses and performance fees are  increasingly high. Even a major event, such as the well-organized and well-attended   16   Dance Research Journal 34/2 (Winter 2002)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    Natyanjali festival that takes place in February in the temple town of Chidambaram, meets  costs with difficulty. As a result, festival organizers are sometimes forced to seek dancers with  large sponsorships behind them. At Natyanjali 2001, for example, Aishwarya, the daughter of  the ultra-popular Tamil cinema icon Rajini Kanth, opened the prestigious event on Shivaratri.  A young woman with no established record as a performer, Aishwarya delivered a perform-  ance described by one critic as "incomplete and devoid of elegance" (Ramani 2001).   With the exception of people like Rajini Kanth, few Indians can compete with the eco-   nomic clout of NRIs. As a result, increasing numbers of performers in Chennai are the daugh-  ters of those living abroad. Many South Asian transnationals send their children to dance les-  sons not with the aim of making them into dancers, but to expose them to Indian culture  (Niyogi-Nakra 1998). Performing in India becomes a source of pride for immigrants, for  whom ethnic identity is often predicated on the "traditional" cultural values they believe are  embodied by India's classical arts (Maira 2002; Mukhi 2000). Some seek chances to perform  whether or not they are ready to take the stage, a fact that many Chennai-based dancers I inter-  viewed lamented, some even to the point of feeling that local dancers were at risk of being dis-  placed.   The political economy of dance criticism also bends production in favor of those who are  fortified with money. Dance reviews from leading publications such as The Hindu, The Times  of India, or India Today are highly prized, as they are instrumental in obtaining further per-  formance opportunities both locally and abroad. Appearing in the newspaper is also a source  of social prestige, the importance of which cannot be overlooked within a system where both  economic and symbolic capital are critical factors in the tooth-and-nail competition for social  standing. It is not uncommon for dancers to hound critics for reviews, showing up at their  homes to personally invite them to performances or to present them with gifts or even outright  offerings of money. One critic writes about a well-known colleague who is rumored to solicit  fees for his reviews, with NRIs allegedly charged at higher rates (Ramani 1998).   The emphasis on dance reviews is a product of the heavy competition that exists by virtue   of the fact that there are so many dancers. Like any supply-heavy economy, marketing is a cru-  cial factor in commanding any sort of regular presence. As one teacher described, "Self-pro-  motion has itself become an art."5 Hyperbolic language and decontextualized citations from  reviews are standard elements in a dancer's press packet. Detailing one's dance activities  abroad offers ample opportunity to create unsubstantiated claims to glory. I myself remember  an article I ran across about five years ago in the prestigious dance and music journal Sruti,  published in Chennai, which mentioned a two-day workshop in "contemporary choreography  in bharatanatyam" that I had attended in New York. Both the photograph and the text might  easily have allowed a reader to conclude that the workshop had generated some amount of  interest. Actually, I had been one of only two participants! By way of another example, one  critic told me about a time when a highly successful dancer insisted that he describe her recent  gigs in the United States as a "coast-to-coast tour." "I wanted to laugh! She was making her-  self sound like Madonna or Bruce Springsteen. But all she did was get on Singapore Airlines,  fly to Los Angeles and perform for a few hundred in some Hindu temple and then fly right to  New York and do the same." Unfortunately, claims like hers go far in enabling one to seek  more opportunities to perform in India.   Once a dancer has secured a performance date, there are substantial production costs to  meet. In Chennai, almost all dance concerts are free. Patronage of the performing arts has all   34/2 (Winter 2002) Dance Research Journal   17  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    but disappeared and government support is minimal. This means that the individual dancer  not only receives nothing for the performance, but also that she or he must frequently meet all  of the production costs. The heaviest cot may be the orchestral accompaniment, which would  include several rehearsals in addition to a performance fee. Then there are payments to be  made to technicians, makeup artists, costume tailors, and set designers. One dancer I spoke  with was adamant about NRIs being in part responsible for creating inflated expectations on  the part of dance collaborators, thereby driving up the costs of production even for local  dancers.   Economic expectations on the part of dance teachers are also in the picture. One scholar   summarized the situation:   We don't have gurus today. We have greedy teachers now. A guru was a per-  son who would sit by the sea, was not very interested in school. Those who  made the effort in trudging all the way to his village wherever, he would say,  "OK, come." If you paid him 10 rupees he was happy, if you did not pay him  10 rupees he was not unhappy. He was not on the market. There's a big dif-  ference. When you teach like say, abhinaya, now, it's in a highly publicized  two-week workshop costing some few thousand rupees or whatever. That's  called commodification of art. And if we are talking that dancers are  mediocre, its because gurus are mediocre. They are just market-savvy and  seminar-oriented gurus, who like their name everywhere and like to float in  and out of committees.   It is hardly a secret that NRIs and other foreigners are willing and able to pay prices up to  many times the going local rates for classes. Some of the young local dancers I met asserted  that some teachers treat foreign or NRI students preferentially, irrespective of their talents,  because of the hope that such students might one day create opportunities for the teacher her-  self or himself to perform and teach abroad. Because foreigners often come to India only for  limited periods of time and with the aim of returning home with more pieces to perform, reper-  tory items are sold to them like commodities. Local dancers also increasingly pay for dance  choreographies. This trend is linked to changes in the traditional format of teaching and audi-  ence demand for new performance material.   Concurrent with increased commodification of choreography is the growth in the market  for recordings of dance music. It is still the case that most bharatanatyam recitals in Chennai  have live music. Outside India, where fewer musicians are available for regular performances,  taped music is the norm. Those who operate schools abroad are sometimes willing to pay  exorbitant rates for studio sessions of Chennai musicians. Seeing such outlays as investments,  many in turn sell dance accompaniment to students at their own schools.   Recognizing that dance can be a profitable business, many Chennaite dancers have  opened schools throughout the city, to the point where, as one leading dancer put it, "dance  schools are a choc-a-block." Those who run such establishments may or may not be recog-  nized experts in the field, which does not prevent them from receiving large numbers of stu-  dents and cranking out arangetrams (debut concerts) by the score. As a result, there are  unprecedented numbers of people proclaiming themselves to be dancers and giving concerts  throughout the city on almost any night of the week.   18   Dance Research Journal 34/2 (Winter 2002)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    Performance  Bharatanatyam is a dynamic artistic form, one that has a long history of adaptation and inno-  vation. The past decade especially, however, has seen many changes in the quality and format  of performance, to the point where many artists wonder what direction the dance will take in  the next decade. Foremost is a decline in the overall quality of dancing, largely a result of there  being too many dancers and the increased importance of money as the deciding factor in an  artistic life. Although local politics and influence have always played a role in determining  who gets to perform at leading venues, many would agree that in the past most of the dancers  performing regularly had achieved some level of excellence. Today, however, many regular  concertgoers and leading dancers complain about a lack of technical mastery and expressive  artistry, except in the case of the handful of truly dedicated artists. Even dancers featured at  major performance spaces and festivals can be inexperienced and unskilled in their physical  execution and improvisation.   First of all, with respect to physical techniques, basic positions, namely the ardhamandali  (similar to a low demi-plie), are in many cases no longer maintained. Basic adavus (steps) do  not begin and return neatly to any starting point and often do not even clearly execute the  intended rhythm. Movements with the arms often lack clear shape. The impact for the viewer  is that basic principles of technique, which can be found across the many styles of the dance  form, are harder to spot. As one older woman, who does not consider herself a connoisseur but  rather a longtime fan of dance, told me laughingly as she waved her arms wildly, "Moving this  way and that ... some of these dancers these days look as sharp as me wearing a costume and  running to dance on the stage!" At the same time, perhaps because technical excellence is  harder to come by, those who possess it are rightfully recognized and held up as models. For  example, people commonly refer to the spectacularly grounded and open ardhamandali of the  star, Urmila Satyanarayan, as a standard to which a dancer should aspire.   There are multiple reasons for what many regard as a disheartening decline in technical  mastery. To begin with, dance training is far less intensive and purposeful. Gone are the days  of the gurukul system, in which student and teacher engaged in extensive interaction over a  period of years. Now most students learn by taking class as often as their busy schedules will  allow. Tremendous competition for seats in colleges places an onerous burden on young peo-  ple who must spend endless hours preparing for critical exams. Few middle-class families  would be happy at the idea of their son or daughter becoming an artist, preferring instead that  they devote themselves to more lucrative and socially recognized fields, such as medicine,  computer science, or engineering. As a result, studying dance is not a primary focus, and its  purpose is rarely to become a professional, full-time performer.   Many of those who come to the dance do not see it so much as an art to be practiced with  care, as yet another achievement that one can then list along with one's other attributes and  accomplishments. Among the first questions one will be asked when telling someone that one  studies dance is, "Have you finished your course?" By this the questioner means to know  whether one has learned an entire set of pieces that comprise the repertory of a full  bharatanatyam concert and whether one has completed one's arangetram. Seeing the arange-  tram as a kind of graduation implies that one's work is somehow done. Performing artists will  say, however, that the arangetram actually marks the beginning of a much more arduous ven-  ture, the process of transforming oneself into an artist being a much longer road than the one  leading up to one's debut.   34/2 (Winter 2002) Dance Research Journal   19  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    So why study dance? Today, dance is associated with being cultured and having class. The   irony in this view lies on two levels. First, until elites in Madras took an interest in this art  form in the first half of the twentieth century, it carried the heavy stigma of the class of  devadasi women who practiced it. Second, while most of today's dancers are high caste and  at least middle-class, patriarchal attitudes about women's bodies taking center stage continue  to pose problems at the level of the family for women who wish to perform. Many of even the  top stars must fight against the wishes of husbands and in-laws to continue their careers after  marriage. Nevertheless, these days in Chennai, having studied dance is believed to lend a  young woman a kind of polish and femininity useful in beefing up her marriageability quo-  tient.7 Ads seeking marriage alliances in newspapers and online routinely list knowledge of  music and dance alongside other relevant data, such as skin color, education, and caste. Thus,  while many dancers are being produced, few choose to refine their skills or perform for many  years.   The fact that many dancers work at other professions is another important reason behind  the decrease in physical skill that one sees onstage. Rising costs of living in India, combined  with the paucity of funds for dance, make working another job almost a requirement for any-  one other than the independently wealthy. The Indian economy does not support the idea of a  "part-time" job, so familiar to actors, dancers, and visual artists in the United States and parts  of Europe. Working, therefore, usually means attending a job full-time in addition to meeting  the demands of household duties. This leaves women very little time for dance. Unfortunately,  practicing with less regularity makes it more difficult to maintain the perfection of the dance's  form. Bharatanatyam requires both strength and stamina to execute well. It also mandates a  lot of what my own guru referred to as "mental work," in order to be able to effectively con-  vey the meaning of the narrative lines. As one teacher pointed out, "If you want to dance on  the stage, then it has to be what you do off the stage also. You should always be dancing, every  day. Now, everyone has so much other work that they are not dancing and not living the dance  in their minds either."   Paradoxically, while there are more dancers who are less proficient, there is growing pres-  sure on those who do have good physical technique to demonstrate their prowess at every turn.  In recent years nritta (non-narrative, rhythmic dance movement) has attained an unprece-  dented importance, to the point where it has become an almost codified display of mandatory  virtuosity. Complex tinmanams (rhythmic sequences) performed with dazzling speed and  alacrity bring consistent applause. Lamenting the fact that many celebrated young dancers  were looking these days like "mechanical dolls," one scholar commented, "Because people do  not know much of poetry or feeling, they try to impress with technical virtuosity and it has in  the process become a mainstay. But how long can you appreciate this? Maybe for half an hour  and you can't see it many times." Echoing these sentiments, a young dancer explained, "The  whole point of the tirmanams used to be to just wake up the audience. Now the whole focus  is on how well these sequences are executed rather than on how well someone is dancing."   Changes of technique are not solely a question of a moving away from conformity to pre-   viously widely held standards. Present-day dance training has also facilitated the tendency  toward a kind of local hybridization of what were once distinct styles of bharatanatyam. This  dance form has long been associated with several lineages or schools. Stylistic differences can  be as fundamental as the distance allowed between the two heels in the ardhamandali, the  position of the arms in an adavu, or the proper expression to be held on the face during the   20   Dance Research Journal 34/2 (Winter 2002)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    nritta portions. They also encompass such things as the musical compositions that form basic  repertory, the complexity of nattuvangam (the composition of rhythmic sequences accompa-  nied by the recitation of syllables), and costume styling. Bharatanatyam represents an oral tra-  dition, in which the transmission of cultural knowledge depended on face-to-face interaction  between people over an extensive period of time. With the passing of traditional gurus, who  were individuals invested for a lifetime in preserving the intricacies of a particular sampra-  daya (school), much of the information about a given lineage is being lost. Concurrently,  many of the dance institutions these days bring together instructors from a variety of schools,  so that students come to perform a kind of composite of many styles.8 This is especially the  case for dancers who now are trained in college degree-awarding programs. For example,  when I asked a young woman graduate of an arts college near Pondicherry what style of  bharatanatyam she did, she replied, "Oh, it's kind of Kalakshetra style, but then there are some  other things thrown in ... you know how it is." The commodification of dance repertory also  contributes to this trend. Studying a short time with a number of gurus with the aim of acquir-  ing more repertory, many dancers perform items from schools other than their own and with-  out the nuances that may have marked a given item's performance in the past.   With respect to the narrative aspects of the dance, many changes can be seen in the per-   formance of abhinaya. Generally speaking, abhinaya is now far simpler than in the past. For  those who train in the dance outside of India, even the most common mythological themes can  be challenging. A well-regarded male dancer in Chennai told me of a time when a friend of  his, who runs a dance school in California, phoned him long distance desperately seeking help.  The woman was putting on a big group production of DasAvatar (The Ten Incarnations of  Lord Vishnu). She was in a panic over not remembering the proper mudra (hand gesture) for  showing Vishnu in his form of matsya (fish). Incredible as it seems that a teacher could forget  something so basic, it is less surprising if one considers the fact that many of those who run  schools outside India had never intended to become professional dancers, let alone teachers,  during their years growing up and studying dance in India. With the ample market for dance  instruction among South Asian immigrant populations, many people who may have received  only average amounts of training growing up in Chennai convert themselves into gurus.   As for more complex ideas in the abhinaya, there is a tendency to lock onto the same ways  of expressing what are actually subtle and complicated passages of text. Today onstage in  Chennai, facial expressions are often highly theatricalized, to the point where they even  resemble the kinds of acting you see in Indian films. For example, dancers in the past relied  to varying degrees on carefully selected metaphors to suggest that a heroine was miserable in  the agony of love. Today it is not uncommon to see a more literal interpretation, such as a  dancer's eyes glittering with tears. This move from connotation to denotation in abhinaya is  in part a move to accommodate an audience more oriented to film and television and less  knowledgeable about dance.9 It is also a function of the fact that in a large auditorium, a highly  refined abhinaya can be readily appreciated only by the audience members sitting in the first  few rows, where the face can be viewed in detail.   The narratives that abhinaya seeks to express have also simplified. This is in part because   many dancers do not have thorough knowledge of the languages in which songs are sung.  Young middle-class residents of Chennai do not even have a firm command of Tamil, the lan-  guage of many dance compositions. Furthermore, many lack an overall knowledge of the  mythology and literature that would permit them to explore poetry with greater sophistication   34/2 (Winter 2002) Dance Research Journal   21  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    and to improvise for longer periods of time upon any single line. This is especially the case  for those dancers trained abroad, who, in fact, often lack the knowledge and ability to impro-  vise at all and instead dance fixed choreographies. Even in the case of local dancers, how-  ever-with the exception of a handful of very hardworking and talented individuals-their  average level of knowledge may not compare with that of previous generations of dancers,  which they conceal by changing the repertory that they perform with every single perform-  ance. As one old-timer remarked to me, "With some of these youngsters, since they never  dance the same piece twice, we simply cannot tell how much they are able to understand and  create from any one piece." It used to be that a particular dancer might dance the same var-  nam (the musical-dance composition that forms the centerpiece of a full-length concert) for a  long time, even at several consecutive performances. In today's environment in which too  many dancers are competing for dwindling audience, it would not be possible to dance the  same items as frequently, since spectators have a strong desire to see something "new."   Changing audience expectations have fomented many changes in the format and content  of bharatanatyam concerts in Chennai. Bharatanatyam is highly codified and requires a sig-  nificant level of connoisseurship in order to be understood beyond a surface level. As the pace  of middle-class urban life has intensified and live performance has been replaced by television  as the primary source of entertainment, fewer people are keen generally to attend dance con-  certs. Even major venues, such as the Madras Music Academy during its prime December sea-  son that features the top artists from all over India, find fewer numbers filling once packed  halls. A quick glance around these auditoriums shows that most audience members are of a  generation that is now sixty years old and over. Creating and sustaining interest in the dance  form is a task faced by most dancers in one way or another. As a result, to speak of a single  dance scene is not fully accurate, as there are actually different kinds of programs going on in  the city that appeal to different kinds of audiences. A concert that other dedicated professional  dancers regard as quality art may draw only fifty people. Programs that succeed in drawing  larger numbers are often regarded by other artists as too entertainment- or novelty-oriented.  These kinds of presentations, however, are more frequently offered in the city.   To appeal to more people, and especially keeping in mind that the majority of them do not  understand in detail much of what they see, many bharatanatyam concerts no longer adhere to  the conventional margam of repertory, in which the dance pieces follow a set sequence of gen-  res from the alarippu through to the tillana and are performed by a single, solo dancer.  Audiences prefer watching either a series of short pieces performed by a succession of differ-  ent dancers or group "ballets" in which mythological stories with many characters are enacted  with several dancers at once. Some group choreographies of classical dance reach such a scale  that they resemble the dance scenes in old Indian films, in which countless numbers of dancers  seem to fill the entire screen. A number performed by students of the cinema star and dancer  Shobhana at the Music Academy in the summer of 2001 featured what appeared to be perhaps  fifty or more dancers onstage at once! In addition, many shows are now oriented around par-  ticular themes, such as dances about Krishna, or the compositions of a particular composer,  such as the Swathi Thirunal festival of the Madras Malayali Club. Not all themes are tradi-  tional. Some dancers concern themselves with social issues, using classical dance to address  present-day situations, such as the condition of street children, the environment, or the con-  flicting demands made on the modern, urban woman.   22   Dance Research Journal 34/2 (Winter 2002)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    The emphasis on finding new modes of expression in classical dance manifests itself  simultaneously in the growing movement of what I refer to as Indian contemporary dance.  This recent phenomenon must be viewed in relation to India's traditional performance and  martial arts traditions, in addition to factors such as the training of some Indian artists in mod-  em dance abroad and the travel of American and European artists to work with dancers in  India. It is difficult to define this form of dance, as there are still relatively few artists creat-  ing work in this line and because they rely to a greater or lesser degree on traditional vocab-  ularies. Dance in India today must be seen as falling along a kind of continuum with varying  degrees of relationship to preexisting forms. For example, the work of Daksha Seth, who has  not had any Western training but has instead conducted a thorough exploration of the classi-  cal dance kathak and the Kerala martial art kalarippayattu, is based on the creation of a new  movement vocabulary. The dancer Padma Subramaniam, on the other hand, remains closely  tied to the bharatanatyam in which she was trained. The thematic content and the addition of  folk performance elements, however, set her dances apart from standard classical presenta-  tions. There are many dancers today both in India and abroad working in this way, continuing  to present themselves as bharatanatyam exponents even as they seek to expand the range of  what constitutes this art form.   Perspectives  Developments in India and abroad spark a wide range of opinions from local artists, produc-  ers, critics, and scholars in Chennai. There is a general frustration on the part of many partic-  ipants in the dance scene over the growing number of bad dancers. A sense of urgency seems  to pervade discussions about the future of the art form, even as individuals disagree on what  kinds of measures might curb the erosion of quality, or even if it is possible to rescue the dance  at all from an inevitable death. Extreme points of view, and all shades in between, speak to the  thorny questions of what exactly constitutes Indian "tradition" and what its role will be in a  rapidly changing India.   The conservative point of view, taken by those who spent their youth regularly attending  performances of top dancers in the days when such dancers could be counted on the fingers  of one hand, disparages any accommodation (in their view) made toward changing audience  tastes. As one old-timer confided, "Our dance was a sacred, ancient tradition, a prayer for the  god and an inspiration for the audience. Now it is only entertainment and they will do any vul-  gar, easy thing." Yet disappointment over the present state of dance is not a sentiment confined  to the older generation. Many young people are equally concerned, to the point where some  view their own practice of the art as a kind of political stance. For example, the Chennai-based  collective Tapasya Kala Sampradaya, led by dancers who promote themselves as students of  the late K. P. Kittappa Pillai, a descendant of the Tanjore Quartet'o and one of the last tradi-  tional gurus, made a strong statement in the program notes for their concert of March 20,  2001, at the Hotel de l'Orient in Pondicherry:   Tapasya Kala Sampradaya is an alliance of dancers, researchers and dance  teachers who hold certain beliefs in common: that excellence in the field of  bharatanatyam needs to be defended against the money-influence nexus; that  performances in the present are marred by superfluous decoration (in cos-  tume, for instance), and need to be pared down to the essential.   34/2 (Winter 2002) Dance Research Journal   23  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    Other young dancers have responded in other ways to the decline of the dance field. The  question for some is not so much that tradition is no longer relevant, as that it has been so  restricted in its practice that its full complexity and diversity of themes is unavailable to audi-  ences. A young woman who has dedicated herself to performing only her own choreography  within the traditional bharatanatyam format, and whose teacher is fully supportive of her  efforts, explained, "In varnams there is not much variety [of theme], but in padams, there is  so much that is there. There are so many composers and so many different situations pre-  sented, but people never choose them because they say it's unacceptable for what they think  a woman should be or a man should be." The same woman told of a time some years earlier  when a dancer, who is highly regarded by young and old alike, performed in a competition a  traditional but rarely seen padam in which a woman informs a man that her husband is out and  that now is a good time for them to play around. According to this informant, it was strongly  believed that the dancer, who seemed for most observers to be by far the most worthy of the  prize, lost the contest on the grounds of having performed such a piece. Moreover, some time  elapsed before this artist, who is accustomed to performing regularly, was given an opportu-  nity to dance on another stage.   There are others who assert that it is only through innovation that the dance can escape its  present stagnation. Contrary to the views of the young woman above, these dancers feel that  the repertory offered by tradition is antiquated. Only in making dance themes relevant to pres-  ent-day situations and attitudes can bharatanatyam survive with any life. This is not always  viewed as a departure from tradition, however. It is interesting that those who endorse such  efforts sometimes draw on a particular interpretation of the Natyasastra, the Sanskrit text that  details the purpose and proper dimensions for theatrical presentation, in order to support inno-  vation. For example, one scholar pointed out, "A very prominent line in the Natyasastra estab-  lishes that what is prevalent in society has to be reflected in dance. That is the definition given  by the earliest treatise for dance and theater. So we are not really deviating if we are changing  themes. We are not really compromising in quality or tradition if we are changing themes. Any  theme, so long as it is there in society, then it is fine."   Some feel that such efforts are attempts to camouflage a dancer's scanty knowledge of lit-  erature and abhinaya. The same holds for much of the so-called experimentation that goes on  at the level of movement vocabulary. Arguing that most innovators are not significantly  exploring the form, one scholar told me:   The question for dancers given the present state of affairs is where do you go  from here? So, they have all been experimenting, innovating and saying they  are carrying the tradition farther. Now these are three very great terms. There  is a whole new school of dancers now who cannot perform margam properly.  So they say, tradition is forever evolving. We are adding to it. So if you can't  stand in araimandi properly, and you can't do adavus or anything else prop-  erly, you say, "This is my contribution." The claim just falls flat. They will do  one production combining kathak footwork with a kathakali mudra and a  bharatanatyam face. That is their version of experimentation and it is only a  half-baked mixture.   24   Dance Research Journal 34/2 (Winter 2002)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    As this quotation reveals, some voices express criticism not on the grounds that tradition  should remain fixed, but out of suspicion that many who are attempting changes in the dance's  format do not have a firm enough grounding from which to investigate and then create new  forms that have any kind of artistic weight or staying power. As one scholar put it, "When you  have rice, you can make biriyani, payasam, or tayar sadam. But without rice, you can't use  anything else. You have to have basic material in order to make something."   Those who speak against innovations are often accused of being reactionary. In his  keynote address at the twentieth annual Natya Kala conference in Chennai, Sri Shyamanand  Jalan, a man involved in various aspects of theater in India, stated:   It has to be recognized that a dancer is a dancer first of all. Then comes the  style and the form. He or she has no obligation to preserve the ancient culture  or heritage, or be a crusader for its preservation and revival. If he or she has  to survive, he or she has to make adjustments with the changing times and the  changing tastes. I find a lack of this basic understanding. The dance world is  dominated by the purists both amongst the critics and the art administrators.  (Jalan 2000)   In the same speech, however, Jalan acknowledged that many dancers today are "people with  limited talents" and raised the question about whether "the truly meritorious" were the artists  who rose to the top.   With so much anxiety over the present state of the art, it is little wonder that there is uncer-  tainty about bharatanatyam's future. Some observers are optimistic, citing the dance's history  of flexibility, accommodation, and resilience. One very prominent dancer exclaimed to me,  "So we know that the format of margam and all came only after the Tanjore Quartet. But we  also know that some kind of form of this dance had existed for long before, even for thousands  of years. It has always been changing, and has always survived. To say that it will disappear  does not make any sense and is simply a very rigid view. I think bharatanatyam will always  be there and it will always be beautiful." Others are optimistic because they believe that in  spite of the deluge of bad dancers, a few fully dedicated professionals are charting a bright  course for the form's future. As one young artist put it, "Even with all the frustration, real pro-  fessionals are leading very exciting artistic lives. Not only do they have to follow standards  for technical excellence, but they also have to demonstrate creativity. As a result so many new  styles and new possibilities are arising."   This viewpoint stands at sharp odds with the sentiments of those who believe that the   dance has already all but met with its demise. A well-known dance critic, one known for his  open-mindedness toward innovation and support for Indian "contemporary dance," con-  cluded, "It is very tragic that in the last century we saw the revival of all our traditional arts,  and within the same period of one hundred years, it will all die." These ominous words, which  speak to the state of the traditional folk and classical performing arts of India generally, should  not be too easily dismissed as mere pessimism, as they are based on a highly valid interpreta-  tion of a range of present indicators.   It is unfortunate that this viewpoint is not heard enough when Indian dance is discussed  by dancers and scholars abroad. It is true that the issues for bharatanatyam and other forms are  different in the foreign context, where concerns focus more on the need to break out of the   34/2 (Winter 2002) Dance Research Journal   25  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    confining "ethnic dance" category to which funding sources and critics have often relegated  such dances.' Nevertheless, in the context of bharatanatyam having become truly a global  dance form, discussions about diasporic practices and challenges should not overlook the fact  that the dance as practiced in its original context is changing and that the relationship between  local practitioners and those living abroad is far more complex than ideas such as "artistic  exchange" imply. In her paper, "Moving Margins: South Asian Dance in the UK," presented  at the Natya Kala conference in 2000, Naseem Khan elaborated on the ways in which South  Asian artists in Britain have successfully moved their art form beyond the margins. With  respect to how these developments relate to interaction with artists in India, she stated:   Over this same time, the relationship with dancers in India has also undergone  change. It is one of professional exchange and not approbation. It is one of  equality rather than of patronage. Choreographers and music composers cre-  ate new work for presentation here and abroad including back in India.  Teachers come from India to conduct master classes and workshops and, in  turn, learn new ways of teaching-across and within culture. It works because  aesthetic sensibilities are widening as dance in India shifts its own margins;  "Indian" culture is no longer a monolithic construct owned by the urban, edu-  cated revivalist. (Khan 2000)   This view reflects a lack of awareness of what is going on currently with the performing  arts in India and how many of those involved feel about developments. It also reveals a lack  of insight into the ways in which the participation of NRIs may have facilitated shifts in local  production. To endorse the widening of Indian aesthetic sensibilities seems an empty celebra-  tion if not tempered with an eye to how many Indian artists, scholars, and critics are concerned  about the quality and future of both innovative and traditional forms.   Summary  Bharatanatyam has a long history of adaptation and modification. In recent years, change has  accelerated and will continue to do so alongside the dramatic economic and social shifts tak-  ing place in India. A look at the current state of the dance's production in Chennai shows  clearly that the increasing commodification of the art form places those with economic and  social resources at a significant advantage. As for the format and quality of performance, the  large number of dancers works in two directions: few master the form in either its technical  or expressive aspects so that little of what one now sees routinely onstage conforms to what  were previously widely accepted standards; and, a surplus of dancers has fueled competition  for performance opportunities. All dancers must somehow face the task of captivating a dwin-  dling pool of spectators and creating new audiences. Some have responded by attempting to  provide audiences with something "new," either changes in the format of performance, pre-  senting contemporary themes, or exploring movement vocabularies to a greater or lesser  degree.   The decrease in overall quality of performance, whether with respect to dancing that   adheres to "tradition" or somehow attempts to build upon it, has left many participants in the  dance scene in Chennai nervous about how bharatanatyam will move into the future. While  not all viewpoints on the subject are apocalyptic, many people believe that the form will   26   Dance Research Journal 34/2 (Winter 2002)  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    inevitably depart from the standards and schools that have characterized it for the last several  decades, and that future generations of dancers may not have a rigorous basis from which to  begin. It is easy to collapse such perspectives into naive nostalgia for the artistic glories of a  fantasy past. Taken in a more constructive way, however, listening to concerns about the direc-  tion the dance is going locally provides a broader context from which to consider the dance's  movement across national and cultural boundaries.   The case of bharatanatyam demonstrates the ways in which globalization must be under-  stood as a field of tensions that play out both in India and abroad. Against the backdrop of an  already global history involving colonialism, nationalism, and the travel of Indian and Western  artists, bharatanatyam today emerges as an entity shaped by local conflicts in Chennai as well  as immigrant fantasies and the global market. Celebrating the dance's proliferation outside  India without taking into consideration the voices of Indian observers does not allow one to  grasp the full complexity of the production and performance of this thoroughly contemporary,  traditional art form.

Featherstone argues that loosely defined terms, such as "global culture," gloss over the fact  there is a wide variety of responses to processes of globalization and that what exists is more  on the order of "global cultures in the in thplural" (Featherstone 1990, 8). McGrew (1992) points  out that it is important to remember that globalization's effects can never be evenly distributed,  given the world's economic and social inequities.   2. King speaks about the need to consider globalization through the arts, as opposed to a social   science perspective. He makes the argument for looking at the contents and context of artistic  performance as they manifest in "global cities," which are "increasingly significant political and  cultural formations that, until now, have been conceptualized and researched more in economic  than social and cultural terms" (King 1997, xii). In looking at artistic production in a city such  as Chennai, I am concerned not only with exploring global processes from the "margins," but  also with underscoring the fact that much of what takes place artistically in the world's centers  of capital (as global cities are often defined) is linked to artistic developments in other places.   3. See Kersenboom-Story (1987) for a detailed ethnographic treatment of the class of women   performers, known as devadasis, and the dasi attam that they practiced. Meduri (1996) pro-  vides an account of the circumstances that surrounded the ban of the devadasi practice during  the colonial period.   4. For a thorough discussion of the political and cultural impacts of NRI money circulating in  India within the context of Hindu nationalism, see Rajagopal (2001). As for the policing of  Indian culture, restrictions placed upon artistic and intellectual freedom by the State are noth-  ing new but have intensified during the years of the right-wing-led BJP government (Banerjee  2000; Mody 2002; Noorani 2000; Thapar 2000).   34/2 (Winter 2002) Dance Research Journal   27  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:03 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    5. Interviews for this research were conducted in Chennai from May 2000 to July 2001, and again  during August 2002. Because the world of music and dance is small and competitive, its inhab-  itants engaged in all kinds of one-upmanship and even backbiting, dancers, critics, and schol-  ars can feel a real need to be cautious of what they say. For this reason, I felt it important from  the outset to guarantee anonymity to all of my informants. Moreover, as debates in the cultural  field in India are frequently personalized, it was my hope to highlight the issues, rather than  contribute to a "who-said-what" kind of dialogue.   6. There is tension caused by the privatization of culture as government funding diminishes, on  the one hand, and insufficient patronage by citizens or corporations to support a flourishing  arts scene, on the other.   7. There may be regional differences in this regard. A young kuchipudi dancer from Hyderabad  complained to me that her parents had been hounding her to stop dancing and start working  out in the gym in order to make herself more attractive to prospective bridegrooms. Based on  the experience of several of her dancer friends, she felt that Hyderabad was far less tolerant of  women occupying public roles in cultural life and that, therefore, unlike in Chennai, dance  training was seen as a liability in the marriage market.   8. This is not altogether a new phenomenon. The biggest school, Kalakshetra, established by  Rukmini Devi in 1938, brought together distinct styles from the earliest days of the institution,  and also incorporated elements of kathakali into the bharatanatyam training and performance.   9. The influence of Indian films on the classical and folk arts poses an interesting counterpoint  to globalization, as it points to a history of the internal commodification of cultural practices  that stands separate from world market forces and India's efforts to market its cultural identity  abroad through art. As noted by Appadurai and Breckenridge (1995), Indian modernity is a  product both of local cultural and historical trajectories, and the flow of images, ideologies,  and capital from other global sites.   10. The Tanjore Quartet refers to four brothers who were musicians in the court of Serfoji II in  Thanjavur in the early nineteenth century. The codification of bharatanatyam into the margam  format is attributed to them.   11.

I  detail  the  principles  appropriated  from  Bharatanatyam  and  Iyengar  yoga  that  have,  in  a  layered  and  intrinsic  manner,  directly and indirectly contributed to a heightened kinaesthetic awareness within my  dance and choreographic practice.  This practice reflects a strong somatic and philosophical ideology, out of which  multiple  body-mind  perspectives  emerge.  Moving  away  from  the  Cartesian  frag- mented  and  objective  view  of  the  body,  this  article  presents  a  holistic  body-mind  stance originating from a non-dualistic experiential approach. The principles appro- priated from Bharatanatyam and Iyengar yoga are highlighted through a mixed- mode  framework  that  includes  experiential  writing  and  images  in  an  attempt  to   Keywords choreography contemporary dance Bharatanatyam Iyengar yoga kinaesthetic awareness somatics  87   Mairéad Vaughan    1.

These  experiences  are  contextualized with reference to specific choreographic work I have created for my  company, Shakram Music and Dance.  What  interests  me,  when  I  explore,  is  the  human  condition  and  the  world we inhabit both temporal and earthly, both subtle and tangible.  I  relish  the  connection  between  the  subtle  unseen  body  and  the  flesh  of bones of our mass: the known and the unknown, the visible and the  invisible. The threshold between these is that creative space I want to  linger in.  (Rosemary Lee cited in Bannerman, Sofaer and Watt 2006: 183)  InTroducTIon In this article I discuss how Iyengar yoga and the South Indian classical dance  form Bharatanatyam inform my contemporary dance practice and, in turn, the  choreographic work I create. I reflect on the principles that I have appropri- ated from both of these disciplines, and trace the philosophical and somatic  perspectives that they have fostered within my practice. My objective is not  to  present  a  comparative  study  of  Bharatanatyam  and  Iyengar  yoga,  but  to  focus  on  the  particular  principles  that  directly  and  indirectly  –  in  a  layered  and intrinsic manner – influence my creative process and, in turn, my choreo- graphic work. I write from the perspective of an artist and researcher working  within the field of contemporary dance and choreography in Ireland.  I  begin  with  a  brief  historical  and  philosophical  introduction  to  both  Bharatanatyam  and  Iyengar  yoga,  and  describe  my  training  in  these  move- ment practices. I discuss how I have appropriated particular principles from  both  disciplines  into  my  contemporary  dance  practice.  Alongside  this,  I  consider  how  these  principles  support  the  emergence  of  what  I  experience  and  conceptualise  as  multiple  body-mind  perspectives.  The  body-mind  perspectives  I  am  referring  to  encompass  the  body  and  the  mind  not  from  a  Cartesian  fragmented  body  perspective,  but  from  a  holistic  and  somatic  perspective  originating  from  a  non-dualistic  approach.  These  multiple  perspectives reflect both Sandra Reeve’s (2011) and Philip Zarilli’s (in Banes  and Lepecki 2007), research frameworks in the fields of dance therapy and  actor  training.  Reeve  presents  various  lenses  through  which  different  body  perspectives and bodily experiences are viewed and felt. I extend these frame- works into new ways of viewing and experiencing the body, specific to the  choreographic field. Although complex experience cannot be easily compart- mentalised,  these  perspectives  reveal  and  illuminate  those  that  resonate  within my own practice. The body-mind perspectives within my own dance  and choreographic practice include: ‘the gestural body’; ‘the accented body’;  ‘the spiritual body’; ‘the energetic body’; ‘the reflective body’; ‘the environ- mental  body’;  and  ‘the  ecological  body’.1 All  of  these  body-mind  perspec- tives have revealed themselves to me as a direct result of particular principles  derived from Bharatanatyam and Iyengar yoga, with which I engage. In sepa- rating them out, I do not wish to oversimplify their existence, but rather to  gain a more clear understanding of their role within my process of making  choreographic work.  88   I include extracts of experiential writing taken directly from personal jour- nals that document my studio practice, as well as photographs that account  for  a  visual  impression  of  my  choreographic  work.  In  doing  so,  I  attempt  to  reflect  the  immediacy  of  the  moving  body  and  its  sensory  experience,  as  well as the ineffable aspect of the creative process I enter into when creating  choreography (Bannerman 2006). Di Benedetto (in Banes and Lepecki 2007)  describes how a large range of stimuli can be lost in the translation process  from movement and sensation to a cognitive and linguistic framework:  A framework that subscribes to the rules of semiotics and cultural sociali- zation – a world which is different from the realm of the senses in which  bodily perception rules […]. The acknowledgement of the realm of the  senses  demands  a  different  style  of  presentation  –  academic  language  is  not  always  the  best  way  to  describe  the  subjective  experience  of  perception.  (Di Benedetto in Banes and Lepecki 2007: 126)  Finally, I contextualise these experiences and appropriations in relation to my  choreographic work.  Bharatanatyam Bharatanatyam is among the oldest classical dance forms of India, with origins  predating  the  Natyashastra.2  The  word  Bharatanatyam  is  composed  of  the  terms  bhava,  which  means  expression;  raga,  which  stands  for  melody;  tala,  which means rhythm; and natya, signifying dance. Literary, architectural and  epigraphical  evidence  testifies  to  its  antiquity,  but  the  dance  in  its  present  form  is  no  more  than  200  years  old.  Bharatanatyam  (previously  known  as  Cathir)  originated  in  South  Indian  temple  complexes  as  a  form  of  embod- ied  worship.  It  has  a  strong  ritual  and  spiritual  heritage  as  a  devotional  dance  form  performed  by  women  known  as  devadasis  (‘servants  of  God’).  Bharatanatyam  is  narrative  in  nature,  depicting  stories  from  Indian  mythol- ogy  and  philosophy,  and  is  also  perceived  as  the  embodiment  of  music  in  visual form. Both yoga and Bharatanatyam are emically conceived as spiritual  practices  and  expressions  of  a  deep  philosophical  heritage  (Schechner  cited  in  Banes  and  Lepecki  2007;  Chatterjea  2004;  Hirschi  2000;  Schwartz  2004;  Venkataraman and Pasricha 2002).  After completing my undergraduate contemporary dance training in 1997  at the Northern School of Contemporary Dance, UK, I travelled to India to  study Bharatanatyam and yoga in Varanasi and Rishikesh. I returned again in  2001 to continue my studies. These intensive periods of study provided me  with a way of accessing what I experienced, and now describe the energetic  body,  the  spiritual  body  and  the  ritual  body.  The  philosophical  and  ritual  approaches  underlying  the  articulation  and  performance  of  Bharatanatyam  was  a  totally  new  experience  for  me.  I  participated  in  one-on-one  tuition,  reflecting  the  guru-student  relationship  in  traditional  Indian  pedagogy.  Bharatanatyam is a strictly codified classical technique, requiring a particular  physical  skill  set  including  strength,  flexibility,  rhythmical  expertise,  a  clear  awareness  of  weight  transference,  and  a  strong  connection  with  the  floor  through  the  use  of  the  pelvis,  legs  and  feet.  Some  of  the  movement  prin- ciples I had mastered as part of my contemporary dance training facilitated  my  embodiment  of  the  form,  but  the  practice  of  mudra  (gesture)  –  which   Emanating awareness  	 2.

The simulta- neous execution of the rhythm of the feet with the articulation of the hands  was  technically  demanding  on  a  number  of  levels.  The  discipline  that  my  professional training had fostered, alongside personal and attentive tuition,  kept me inspired, focussed and motivated.  The  influence  of  Indian  classical  dance  in  contemporary  choreography  can be seen directly in the work of British-Asian choreographers like Akram  Khan and Shobana Jeyasingh. Both Indian classical dance and contemporary  dance inform their respective choreographic practices, and their work reflects  what some describe as a ‘fusion’ of dance genres – although this term is often  contested  as  being  over-simplistic  in  its  approach.  Looking  back  in  history,  American  choreographer  and  dancer  Ruth  St.  Denis  was  highly  influenced  by Indian dance. In 1931 she founded The Society of Spiritual Arts, and later  formed a Church of the Divine Dance due to her interest in dance as an instru- ment of worship. Postmodern choreographer Yvonne Rainer travelled to India  in  1971  and  drew  from  Indian  epics  to  inspire  her  work  (Chatterjea  2004).  Postmodern  artists  Steve  Paxton,  Lisa  Nelson  and  Deborah  Hay  were  also  strongly  influenced  by  a  variety  of  eastern  movement-based  practices  such  as yoga, t’ai chi ch’uan and aikido (Bales and Nettl-Fiol 2008). Bharatanatyam  dancer and contemporary choreographer Chandralekha is renowned for her  integration of postmodern contemporary dance, yoga and Bharatanatyam. She  continuously expresses her disillusionment within the current commercialisa- tion of Bharatanatyam:  I realized how the body and its sensuality had been entirely sublimated  and  negated  in  deference  to  the  notion  of  the  decorative.  Where  was  the body? It struck me that the recovery of the body could be a specific  project in the Indian dance context.  (Chatterjea 2004: 45)  Chandralekha’s  deconstruction  of  Bharatanatyam  right  down  to  its  basic  principles  is  powerfully  minimal.  She  believes  Bharatanatyam  has  become  prescriptive in the name of ‘tradition’, and her choreographic work explores  the  context  and  the  location  of  the  dancing  body  in  contemporary  India.  The commercialisation of Bharatanatyam, the objectification of the body and  the  presentational  approach  used  within  some  performance  contexts  is  not  where  my  interest  lies;  it  is  within  its  embodied  philosophical  and  spirit- ual  approach.  I  resonate  with  Chandralekha’s  performance  philosophy  that  focuses on, ‘a grounded, tensile and constantly mobile power which enables a  process of constant “becoming” rather than one of “performing”’ (Chatterjea  2004: 232).  From 1999 to 2007 I was continuously absorbing and exploring particular  elements  of  Bharatanatyam  through  processes  of  embodiment,  deconstruc- tion  and  bricolage  (Bales  and  Nettl-Fiol  2008).  My  explorations  included  a  conscious  and  unconscious  corporeal  dialogue  between  Bharatanatyam  and  contemporary dance, together with a range of other related artistic disciplines  that supported me to evolve an intertextual approach to the creative process.  This  is,  in  turn,  reflected  within  the  emergent  choreographic  works  of  that  period.3 I did not interpret this dance form in a representational manner, but  I allowed specific principles that I had appropriated to ingrain into my work,  leaving a residue or a suggestive imprint.   mudra And The gesTurAl body An example of how yoga, Bharatanatyam and Indian philosophy are connected  is  in  the  use  of  symbolic  gestures  or  mudras.  According  to  Hirschi  (2000),  mudras  can  vividly  depict  certain  states  of  consciousness  within  the  dance  nexus; conversely, specific gestures can also lead to the states of conscious- ness they symbolise within the practice of yoga. Within hatha yoga, mudras  are expressed within the asanas (physical postures) to intensify their effect. In  Indian classical dance, they are primarily used as a narrative device, but are  also recognised for their embodied effect. This effect is described as a sealing  of energetic circuits:  The  human  has  five  fingers  and  five  toes  on  each  side  of  his  body  because he has five flows of Pranic energy, which terminates in each of  the digits. There are five flows from head to foot on the right side, and  five flows from head to foot on the left side […]. Bringing these various  diverse flows of Pranic energy into closed circuits (“sealing” the energy  flow) is one of the methods by which Mudra achieves its purpose.  (Bhavanan Balayogi and Bhavanani 2001: 16)  Within my dance practice I am aware that the articulation of an abstract non- narrative  gesture  can  contain  within  it  (and  reflect)  a  particular  emotion  or  sensation, or simply evoke a particular atmosphere or state of consciousness.  The rich pool of mudra is a resource I draw from in order to create my own  individual responses. Mudra inspires me to enter into an embodied dialogue  in which I respond in an intuitive, spontaneous manner. Through repeatedly  improvised,  layered  and  detailed  explorations,  I  eventually  begin  to  devise  vocabulary. Out of this practice, the gestural body emerges. This process has  contributed greatly to the development of my own gestural movement vocab- ulary and, in turn, my choreographic ‘signature’.  Tracing  patterns  on  the  floor  surface,  walls  and  ceiling,  behind,  in  front,  above  and  below  […].  Signs  and  symbols,  semiotic  language  of  complex  abstraction,  derived  from  the  art  of  mudra  but  extended  to  another space, time – absorbed, embraced, embodied – reconfigured – a  deep connection with ancient detail and mysterious emblem guides me  further through the concealed […].  (Vaughan August 2012 journal extract)  I  began  creating  this  gestural  signature  twelve  years  ago  within  the  crea- tion  process  of  ‘Matra’  (2002),  a  collaborative  live  sound  and  dance  piece.4  ‘Matra’  was  influenced  largely  by  the  gestural  and  rhythmical  elements  of  Bharatanatyam,  as  well  as  yoga.  Gesture  was  explored  through  a  long  complex  process  of  deconstruction,  reconfiguration  and  bricolage  until  a  new  semiotic  vocabulary  began  to  emerge.  Through  a  process  of  improvi- sation,  I  explored  the  timing  and  phrasing  possibilities  of  particular  mudras.  I  began  to  create  responses  with  different  body  parts,  variations  of  levels,  spatial  relationships  and  dynamics  in  an  abstract,  instinctual  and  embodied  manner. The gestural body within ‘Matra’ created a geometric, angular form.  The angularity of the arms fed down into the legs and into the feet, creating  an  oppositional  dynamic  whereby  an  arm  reached  in  one  direction  as  a  leg  extended  in  the  opposite  direction.  This  angularity  extended  out  into  space   Emanating awareness    4.  The term matra comes   from Indian music  theory, and relates   to one beat in a   rhythmic cycle.  91   Mairéad Vaughan  92  Figure 1: ‘Turbulence’ (2005). Shakram Music and Dance Company.

According  to tradition, Bharatanatyam is inspired by mandalas, mystical patterns associ- ated with the seven chakras of the body. These patterns are said to energise  the body as it moves through direct patterns in space:  A distinctive feature of the Bharatanatyam is the fact that it conceives of  movement in space mostly along either straight lines or in triangles or in  circles, by which we gain a lot of energy. These movements are in actual  fact,  moving  lines,  which  come  together  in  discernible  patterns.  These  patterns reflect or mirror the Mandalas (mystic shapes or forms), which  are associated with the six Chakras of the human psychic energy body.  (Bhavanan Balayogi and Bhavanani 2001: 17)  The gestural body within my choreographic work evolved into a sculptural form  when I worked alongside four dancers and two live musicians for ‘Turbulence’  (2005). The dancers moved around each other in close proximity, down and across  linear spatial pathways. Strong images of moving sculpture began to manifest  out of the geometric lines within the gestural form and the relational interactive  dynamic between the dancers moving in close proximity. The space in-between  the  dancers  became  highlighted  due  to  their  close  proximity  and  the  lack  of  physical bodily connection. The notion of sculpting the space around the body  emerged; it drew my awareness to the space surrounding and in-between the  dancers’ bodies, and to how it held a strong energetic resonance.  Nritta and the accented body Through working collaboratively over the past fourteen years with composer  and musician Dara O’Brien, the accented body emerged as a strong presence  within  my  practice.  Our  improvisational  exchanges  explore  the  boundaries    of  movement  and  sound,  examining  how  they  relate,  support  and  oppose  each  other.  Having  studied  Indian  classical  dance  and  music  simultane- ously in India, we were inspired by the tradition’s strong collaborative ethos,  and allowed this to reflect upon our multi-disciplinary collaborative practice  within a contemporary context. This resulted in the creation of our company,  Shakram Music and Dance Company.5  An  ‘accent’  in  musical  terms  is  when  a  note  or  beat  is  emphasised  or  highlighted.  I  experience  the  accented  body  within  my  practice  as  layers  of  embodied memory that reflect the long-term collaborative dialogue between  live  music  and  dance,  as  well  as  my  engagement  with  the  specific  rhythm  and time variations of Bharatanatyam. The accented body reflects and high- lights the culturally specific embodiment of time and rhythm, both specific to  contemporary dance practice and to Bharatanatyam. The embodied accents, or  nuances, of these dance practices have left traces and imprints that I describe  as  the  ‘accented  body’.6  This  body  continues  to  hold  a  strong  resonance  within my practice, albeit in a less conscious manner. It now also exists within  silence due to years of embodied explorations, where imagined impulses and  responses from our collaborations are felt and remembered as rhythmic senses  that are ingrained in a layered and intrinsic manner.  Within  ‘Matra’  (2002),  the  complex  rhythmic  nature  of  Bharatanatyam  –  known  as  nritta  –  was  deconstructed  and  re-interpreted  through  collabora- tive  sound  and  movement  improvisational  tasks.  In  Bharatanatyam,  music  and  dance  have  an  integral  relationship,  with  the  movement  being  a  direct  representation  of  the  sound.  Within  our  creative  process,  both  dance  and  music  shared  an  equal  role.  We  entered  into  a  sustained  dialogue,  evolving  particular interactive structures within a contemporary context. I constructed  phrases  of  gestural  movement  that  also  created  strongly  rooted  rhythmic  sound with the soles of the feet as they connected down into the surface of  the floor. These phrases were then layered by collaborative interactions with  live  sound.  Variations  of  timing  and  syncopated  rhythms  against  the  juxta- position of moments of stillness and silence were all explored. Yoga postures  inspired starting points that dissolved into movement explorations. Postures  also facilitated points of stillness, rest, pause and reconnection.  Both  yoga  and  the  nritta  aspect  of  Bharatanatyam  have  stimulated  my  interest in movement that has a strong sense of weight and a deep sense of  connection that travels down through the sole of the foot, past the floor and  deep into the earth. I experience this as an innate, instinctual response within  my body, feeling this strong, supportive connection of the earth – almost like  a craving to connect with the natural environment. Within Bharatanatyam:  The  physical  contact  of  the  foot  against  the  ground  is  sacred,  for  it  precipitates existence. What is lifeless and dormant is animated by the  touch of a foot; hence the soles of the dancers’ feet are painted red, the  auspicious colour associated with growth and fertility.  (Schwartz 2004: 31)  The  following  studio  journal  extract  documents  the  strong  foot-to-floor  connection that exists within my practice:  Foot bones, imprinting, tracing, weighty symbols deep down past the floor, root-like extension from skin surface, folding into the earth.

(Vaughan May 2012 journal extract)  rasa And The spIrITuAl body The word rasa is used to describe the overall mood of a performance. It is a  central concept within the performing arts in India. ‘Rasa translates directly as  “taste”, “essence” or “flavour”’ (Schwartz 2004: 5). In India, it is a term that  is  used  as  a  lens  through  which  performance  may  be  experienced,  sensed,  viewed, discussed and/or described. It is of interest to note that in ayurvedic  medicine, rasa is known as ‘one of the seven essences that maintain the integ- rity of the organism’ (2004: 8).  There are eight principal rasas documented in the Natyashastra that are said to  evoke specific emotional states. According to the Natyashastra, the central role of  the performing arts and the embodiment of rasa is not to entertain, but to evoke  divine creativity and transcendence of worldly experience both to the performer  and to the audience. Terms like ‘divine presence’, ‘transformative qualities’ and  ‘sacred  space’  are  all  commonly  used  to  describe  the  performance  experience  which is ritualistic in nature (Schechner in Banes and Lepecki 2007).  While predominantly searching for the philosophical and political articu- lations of the body, and in an attempt to bring rasa into a more contemporary  context, Chandralekha distances herself from the ancient esoteric understand- ing, redefining it as ‘a harmonious integration of the individual with himself,  with  society  and  nature’  (in  Chatterjea  2004:  48).  My  approach  is  similar  to  this. I am interested in how psychophysical practices that develop awareness,  consciousness and presence support me within my creative process, and how  I engage with and encounter environments in which I create work. Out of this  immersive practice, the spiritual body emerges.  Within my dance practice, I am also inspired by the concept of rasa in terms  of its direct translation as ‘essence’, with a dictionary definition of ‘the intrinsic’  or ‘indispensable’ properties that serve to characterise or identify something. In  a quest to find deeper meaning, I am on a continuous journey within my dance  practice to try to define what the essence of my choreographic work is. I enjoy  the challenge of being able to pinpoint or associate a particular moment, move- ment or sensation that might reflect the essence of my work. Through collabo- rative practice with a wide variety of multi-disciplinary artists, I am supported  to become aware of the varying perspectives that might be felt or experienced  within the work. These can contribute to new, redefined starting points with  which to engage, or highlighted moments that are filled with personal reso- nance. Discovering the essence is like a filtering system: it helps to focus in,  to magnify, to go deeper and extend out once again into space with a clearer  sense of what the ultimate essence of the choreography might be.  The  evolution  of  my  choreography  and  movement  style  can  be  seen  by  comparing the ten-year process between ‘Matra’ (2002) and ‘Memory Trace’  (2012).  Both  works  are  directly  informed  by  principles  of  Bharatanatyam.  In  ‘Matra’  one  can  observe  the  deep  lunges  inspired  by  both  yoga  and  Bharatanatyam  postures  simultaneously,  alongside  the  dynamic  rhyth- mic  sounds  produced  by  the  feet.  The  movement  is  dynamic,  oppositional,  rhythmic  and  intense,  with  direct  linear  spatial  patterns  throughout.  In  ‘Memory Trace’ rhythmic elements that are traditionally performed by the feet    Emanating awareness    7.  Pranayama is   composed of two  Sanskrit words: Prana,  meaning life force, vital  energy or breath; and  ayama, meaning to  extend or draw out.  95  Figure 2: ‘Matra’ (2002).

Touch  is  explored  as  a  sensory  tool  to  redi- rect or initiate movements that extend out into more curved spatial patterns.  Rhythm  is  experienced  as  an  inner  impulse  rather  than  an  external  initia- tion. In ‘Memory Trace’ the gestural movement is softened, but maintains a  rhythmical quality with more of an internal connection. The focus is on the  movement in-between each gesture, producing a more subtle, suggestive and  continuous movement style that still maintains clarity of line within the form.  InTroducTIon: IyengAr yogA Iyengar  yoga  is  a  form  of  hatha  yoga,  an  ancient  physical  science  based  on  asana (physical posture) and pranayama (breath control).7 According to tradi- tion, asanas apparently originated out of the observation of the movement of  animals  and  the  natural  environment  (Iyengar  1966).  Hatha  yoga  is  said  to  facilitate control over the body-mind. Practicing asanas with an awareness of  the internal sensations and inner physiological systems allow for a heightened  kinaesthetic understanding of the body. Within the yogic tradition, long-term  practice of pranayama and asana leads to the cultivation of an ability to create  spaciousness around oneself; a space that can support a witnessing of the body- mind,  ideally  leading  to  higher  states  of  awareness  and  consciousness.  I  am  interested in developing this level of awareness so that I might be better able  to observe my habitual patterns that recur in my choreographic works. My aim  in becoming conscious or aware of these patterns is to release them in order to  generate new pathways and new discoveries. As previously mentioned, post- modern  artists  like  Steve  Paxton,  Lisa  Nelson,  Yvonne  Rainer  and  Deborah  Hay appropriated from a variety of eastern movement-based practices such as  yoga, t’ai chi ch’uan and aikido to inform their dance and performance practice  (Bales and Nettl-Fiol 2008). Many dance practitioners continue to allow yoga  to influence their practice, as well as their choreographic work.   Mairéad Vaughan    8.  The Sanskrit word nadi  comes from nad which  means ‘channel’, ‘flow’  or ‘stream’.  96  Pranayama introduces practitioners to the respiratory system. Prana is a subtle  energy life force similar to chi in Chinese medicine. It is said to flow throughout  the body through channels called nadis.8 The nadis in which prana flows meet  and  connect  at  intensive  energy  points  in  the  body  called  chakras.  There  are  seven  main  chakras  in  the  body,  described  as  spinning  spheres  of  energetic  activity often seen as powerhouses that generate and store energy in the body.  Chakras are said to interact with the physical body through two major networks:  the endocrine system and the nervous system. Each chakra is associated with  particular  parts  of  the  endocrine  system  (Iyengar  1966;  Rama,  Ballentine  and  Ajaya 2010). I experience chakras within my studio practice as follows:  Bony grating grinding tailbone rooting down spiralling to connect into  the  earth.  Top  of  the  head  radiates  lightness  to  the  universe  residing  above.  Lightness  versus  rootedness.  Crown  chakra  versus  root  chakra  opening and receiving from above transporting down into the container  of  the  pelvis  to  reside  at  the  base  before  blasting  back  up  like  a  fresh  spring water geyser – electric current of sensations.  (Vaughan June 2012 journal extract)  I trained intensively in Iyengar yoga in an ashram in Rishikesh, North India.  Iyengar yoga is highly technical in terms of the detailed instruction and focus  on structural alignment within asana. Classes include precise, verbal instruc- tion and descriptions that encourage a deep experiential understanding of the  anatomy. This kind of practice elucidates the importance of an attunement or  an amplified attentiveness to ‘self’ and to inner experiences within practice. For  me, this attunement – alongside the practice of pranayama – revealed a direct  pathway to what is frequently described as the ‘subtle body’, or the ‘energetic  body’, within the yoga tradition. I experienced a kind of inward journey that  drew my focus to a subtle flow of energy that vibrated within my body.  Prana And The energeTIc body I began to experience yoga as a stripping-away process of the tension and bad  habits  I  had  picked  up  during  dance  training.  I  continue  to  experience  it  as  a constant revisiting and peeling away of deeply ingrained, habitual mental,  emotional  and  physical  patterns.  I  resonate  with  Miranda  Tufnell  when  she  says: ‘The state in which you begin work determines the quality of material  found’ (Crickmay and Tuffnell 1999: 1).  Bringing my awareness to my breath and its circular action connects me,  on  my  inhalation,  to  my  inner  body  space  of  organs  and  bodily  functions  and, on my exhalation, to the outer world or space that I relate to. The breath  is  thus  a  mediator  of  the  two  spaces  –  inner  and  outer.  Within  my  creative  process, I consider the breath as a place where I can continuously start from  and return to. Awareness of breath supports me in initiating movement path- ways. The filling and emptying of the lungs – the expansion and contraction  of the ribcage – can extend out into the limbs. I find that a deep awareness  of breath has allowed me to develop a fluidity and grounded-ness within my  movement  practice;  breath  fosters  a  feeling  of  release  and  softening  of  my  body-mind  while  moving.  Here  is  an  account  of  how  the  breath  is  experi- enced within my studio practice:  Stillness and pause facilitates a settling, a centring, a deep listening (and  noticing), a releasing, an opening, a journey down further and further    Emanating awareness  into  a  state  of  alive  awareness  and  imagination.  A  vibrating  energy  extends  throughout  my  system.  The  breath  blows  the  current  of  my  blood flow. The lungs swell and shrink. Pulsating. An initiation is made  generating tiny, subtle, gentle movement. Awareness begins to extend  out from the inner space of veins and membranes to the outer space of  surfaces and textures. The body emerges from the floor like a sea crea- ture dripping wet. A radiation from inside out, as one responds to the  other.  I  stay  present  and  attentive  to  the  immediacy  of  the  moment.  Snakelike I shed my crisp, dead skin.  (Vaughan June 2012 journal extract)  When  practicing  asana  alongside  pranayama,  I  experience  a  strong  sense  of  an oppositional flow of energy within my body. Lines or meridians of energy  emerge  radiating  throughout  the  system  in  an  oppositional  manner,  down  through the soles of the feet into the ground that redirect back up the body,  out through the fingertips and the top of the head. This oppositional or two- directional,  relational  flow  of  energy  extends  from  the  body  in  a  multidirec- tional manner. This informs the body’s connection to the surrounding space,  as  well  as  an  awareness  of  the  body  within  the  space.  Reviewers  and  peers  have frequently described my movement vocabulary as oppositional in nature.   Figure 3: ‘The Anima and Animus’ (2007). Shakram Dance Company. Dancers –  Olwen Grindley, Jennifer Fleenor and Miriam Ribon.  97   Mairéad Vaughan  98  I attribute this as a direct result of my practice of yoga and Bharatanatyam. This  oppositional nature was contextualised within a choreographic work I created  called ‘The Anima and Animus’ (2007). As the title suggests, this piece explored  the unconscious, relational and apparently oppositional dynamic of the male  and female archetypes that, according to Jungian psychology, reside within us.  The movement vocabulary was gestural and linear in form, with moments of  dynamic  rhythmical  movement  phrases  performed  with  the  dancers  in  very  close proximity to each other although rarely touching. Movement variations  went from long moments of stillness, juxtaposed with fast gestural and explo- sive  moments,  back  into  slow,  methodical,  continuous  movement  that  jour- neyed down direct, linear pathways cutting through the energised space.  Within  the  practice  of  asana,  the  subtle  energetic  body  is  activated  and  enlivened through a deep awareness or attention to the generation of breath  and its circulation around the entire system. This invisible, or ‘subtle body’ as  it  is  sometimes  described  in  yoga,  becomes  visible  by  cultivating  an  aware- ness of it. It can be experienced as heat and/or a tingling sensation that flows  throughout the body. It extends into the extremities of the body to enliven the  sensation in the fingertips and the tips of the toes. This cultivation of energy  and attunement to the inner system develops an awareness and engagement,  which Zarilli (in Banes and Lepecki 2007: 59) describes as ‘the body becomes  all  eyes’  or,  as  Yasuo  Yuasa  (in  Banes  and  Lepecki  2007:  67)  describes  it,  ‘the  circuit  of  unconscious  quasi-body’.  I  am  in  constant  dialogue  with  the  energetic  body  when  moving.  It  shifts  me  through  space  and  sends  me  on  particular spatial pathways, in and out of varying movement qualities.  The ecologIcAl body And The enVIronMenTAl body Out  of  the  energetic  body  –  with  its  multidirectional  meridians  (or  nadis)  extending from the inner body in a relational manner out to the surrounding  space – emerges a strong desire to communicate with the greater surrounding  environment. This expansion of energy extends out to my inevitable relation- ship  with  both  environment  and  ecological  systems.  According  to  Zarilli  (in  Banes and Lepecki 2007: 56), psychophysical practices enhance or deepen both  ‘the inner/depth core and the outer world one encounters’. He explains how  psychophysical practices like yoga foster an ability to stay actively engaged in a  state of body-mind awareness, while also encountering and responding to the  surrounding environment through a range of senses. This engagement extends  ‘both to the depths within and to the world outside the body’ (2007: 62).  An  inner  ecological  system  is  reflected  within  the  body’s  constant  self- cleansing  processes  such  as  exhalation  (omitting  carbon  dioxide),  perspira- tion, digestion and excretion. The organs hold a natural ecology that attempts  to  maintain  a  waste-free  environment  (Rama,  Ballentine  and  Ajaya  2010).  There are a whole series of cleansing practices within hatha yoga – known as  kriyas – that support this inner ecological system. Within my dance practice,  I  sense  that  yoga  has  instilled  within  me  a  deep  awareness  of  my  connec- tion and my relationship with the natural environment and ecological system.  As  previously  mentioned,  it  is  commonly  believed  within  the  tradition  that  many asanas originated out of (and were inspired by) close observation and  reflection on animal movement and the natural landscape. Within my dance  practice, I am interested in exploring the body’s innate response to its envi- ronment,  and  the  delicate  balance  between  the  body’s  internal  architecture  and its sensory relationship with its surroundings.   Emanating awareness  Figure 4: ‘Frozen’ (2009). Shakram Dance Company. Dancers – Olwen Grindley  and Mairéad Vaughan.  I have created a number of site-specific works: ‘Cylinder’ (2005), devised  and performed in a Martello tower; ‘Frozen’ (2009), a dance film created in the  Garden of Remembrance and the streets of inner-city Dublin; and ‘Stone and  Form’ (2011), a dance film created in a castle ruin. As I worked in these envi- ronments,  I  became  aware  of  multiple  levels  of  conscious  and  subconscious  material that I needed to process in order to make choreographic decisions. On  one level, the choreography is consciously crafted for, and influenced directly  by, the location, architecture and historical information. However, there is also  a point where I often experience my body-mind taking over. It enters into a  subconscious sensory and energetic dialogue with the space. I experienced this  dialogue between the body and the various locations as happening on an intui- tive level, as if aspects of the space and surrounding landscape were sensed and   99   Mairéad Vaughan  felt. The principles I have appropriated from my yoga practice aid in the media- tion of body and space, facilitating a deep awareness of my inner body and how  it relates to its surrounding environment. As a choreographer, before I embark  on  a  new  project,  I  prepare  a  choreographic  plan  that  includes  the  methods  and tools I may use to support me in the creative process; but there also comes  a surrender of the plan; a release of control; a jump into the unknown.  sTIllness And The reflecTIVe body One of yoga’s most fundamental principles is stillness: a stillness of body,  breath, mind and spirit. In yogic philosophy, stillness promotes a quietening  of the mind; a releasing of one’s attachments to thought, concept, appear- ance,  image  and  judgement  in  order  to  experience  what  can  be  described  as  an  underlying  pure  awareness  or  consciousness  (Iyengar  1966).  Within  my  personal  practice,  stillness  and  a  connection  to  breathing  allow  me  to  access  this  awareness  through  states  of  deep  relaxation.  This  relaxation  is  active, and instils in me a sense of calmness, balance, focus and clarity. Out  of  this  practice,  I  can  sense  my  reflective  body  emerging  as  a  constantly  evolving  body  consciousness.  This  heightened  body  awareness  facilitates  self-knowledge, and supports me in exploring new pathways of bodily expe- rience  in  the  discovery  and  search  for  new  ways  of  moving.  The  reflective  body facilitates me in the choices and decisions I make when creating chore- ographic  work.  I  am  aware  of  my  habitual  movement  that  has  developed  into my own specific signature, and through this amplification of awareness,  I  can  choose  to  follow  this  signature  or  I  can  choose  to  move  away  from  habit into the unknown.

As a choreographer, I have used stillness as a tool that facilitates a deliberate  kind of seeing so as to allow the audience the opportunity to fully observe a  particular moment within the choreography. I find that pauses or moments of  stillness within movement can create gaps that the audience might fill with  significance, meaning and personal interpretation. Stillness can also facilitate  a  redirection  of  gaze  from  performer  to  audience,  allowing  the  audience  to  become more actively engaged.  TrAnsforMATIons More  recently,  I  have  experienced  a  steady  ongoing  transformation  within  my dance practice and my choreographic signature: a softening of the edges  of  the  gesture,  a  quietening  of  the  stomp  of  the  foot  into  the  floor,  and  a  deep  awareness  of  the  flow  of  energy  throughout  my  body  when  moving.  This  transformation  is  a  direct  result  of  the  principles  I  have  appropriated  from  Iyengar  yoga  and  Bharatanatyam  over  the  past  decade.  The  influences  of mudra, nritta and rasa have supported the emergence of the gestural body,  the accented body and the spiritual body within my practice. The art of mudra  has profoundly influenced the development of my own idiosyncratic gestural  movement vocabulary. Nritta has fostered an exploration of my inner impulses,  as well as a rich collaborative practice with live voice, sound and movement  in performance. Rasa’s philosophical ethos – where the artist is considered a  channel for divine creativity and transcendence – resonates strongly with my  own experience and ideological stance.  Iyengar yoga and the principles I have appropriated from the practice of  asana, pranayama and stillness have fostered the emergence of the energetic  body,  the  ecological  body,  the  environmental  body  and  the  reflective  body.  These  practices  have  allowed  a  deep  connection  to  breath,  inner  sensations  and physiological systems; an experiential anatomical journey that draws my  attention to the continuous flow of energy throughout my body. It supports  an awareness of an inner body space that extends out in a relational dialogue  with the wider environment in an integrated manner.  Within my choreographic work, I am now more aware of stillness, quiet  moments where suggestions are evoked rather than stated, and potent vacant  spaces  are  found  in-between  and  surrounding  moving  bodies.  Suggestion  rather than effect, and atmosphere rather than statement, are now hallmarks  of my evolving work. For me, this invites a different kind of engagement for  the choreographer, dancer and audience.  At  present,  I  am  interested  in  how  best  to  represent  the  multiplicity  of  the body-mind, and its potential for direct embodied, sensory and kinesthetic  response within performance. My principle aim is to present the body-mind  in a non-objectifying manner. I am commited to discovering ways in which  audiences  can  experience  my  choreography  in  an  immersive,  meaningful,  embodied sense. I am also interested in how the dancing body’s response to  its  environment  can  reveal  layers  of  embedded  history  or  energetic  residue  within site-specific performance spaces, as well as the body’s powerful poten- tial or agency to expand – or indeed reconstruct – the audience’s perception  of a particular site.  I continue to allow appropriations from Bharatanatyam and Iyengar yoga  to  channel  unfolding  pathways  within  my  creative  process.  I  can  pause  in  stillness  and  move  with  awareness,  attentively  listening  and  waiting  for  the   Emanating awareness  101   Mairéad Vaughan  102  cyclical  impulses  of  inner  and  outer  spaces  to  manifest  out  of  the  blurred  thresholds of the unknown.  Finding a place of stillness – I dissolve into the floor like a pool of blood,  bone and soft tissue. The story of the breath commences, guiding me to  travel into another space, a space inside, source space, where other spaces  begin to unfold. I am in the studio – alone – silent – still – listening –   present. I am surrounded by empty space waiting for my imprint. This  in between waiting space of potential – the not knowing is where the  challenge lies – from here the hint of creativity unfolds […].

Increasingly, as we all become accomplished semioticians, clothing becomes the  key signiﬁer in determining social interaction and behaviour, and sartorial norms  dictate socio-cultural appropriateness. Following the rise of fashion theory, on  an everyday level, we all understand that our clothes ‘say’ something about us,  about our times, nation, system of values.

Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Eye movements, attention, and expert   knowledge in the observation of                Bharatanatyam dance   Raganya Ponmanadiyil   McMaster University,   Canada   Matthew H. Woolhouse   McMaster University,   Canada   Previous research indicates that dance expertise affects eye-movement behaviour—dance  experts tend to have faster saccades and more tightly clustered fixations than novices when  observing dance, suggesting that experts are able to predict movements and process chore- ographic information more quickly. Relating to this, the present study aimed to explore (1)  the effects of expertise on eye movements (as a proxy for attentional focus and the exist- ence  of  movement-dance  schemas)  in  Indian  Bharatanatyam  dance,  and  (2)  narrative  dance,  which  is  an  important  component  of  Bharatanatyam.  Fixation  durations,  dwell  times,  and  fixation-position  dispersions  were  recorded  for  novices  and  experts  in  Bha- ratanatyam  (N  =  28)  while  they  observed  videos  of  narrative  and  non-narrative  Bha- ratanatyam  dance.  Consistent  with  previous research,  experts had shorter fixation  dura- tions and more tightly clustered fixations than novices. Tighter clustering of fixations was  also found for narrative dance versus non-narrative. Our results are discussed in relation to  previous dance and eye-tracking research.   Keywords: Bharatanatyam, dance, music, eye tracking, fixations, attention, expertise   Introduction   Dance has long been recognized as a universal, non- verbal communicative medium through which emotional  states,  social  narratives,  and  myths  may  be  conveyed  (Hanna,  1987).  Evidence  from  dance  and  emotion  re- search suggests that humans are highly attuned to danc- ers’  affective  states,  communicated  through  body  and  limb movements; see Bläsing, Calvo-Merino, Cross, Jola  and  Stevens,  2012,  for  overview. For  many  world  cul- tures, music and dance are not separable cultural catego- ries; for example, Merriam (1964, p. 275) quotes Gbeho  as stating that in the indigenous music of the Gold Coast  “If  we  speak  of  a  man  being  musical  we  mean  that  he  understands  all  the  dances,  the  drums  and  the  songs.”  From  a  global,  cultural  perspective,  dance  is  frequently  integrated  into  ritualistic  and  religious  ceremonies,  both  in  contemporary  societies  (e.g.  Gundlach,  2006,  pp.  89-  Received March 14, 2018; Published Dec 18, 2018.

Moreover, dance is  considered  an  essential  ingredient  in  the  formation  and  maintenance of group identities (Kirschner & Tomasello,  2010; Miles, Nind, & Macrae, 2009; Cirelli, Einarson &  Trainor,  2014).  For  example,  Lobo  and  Winsler  (2006)  investigated  the  effects  of  an  instructional  program  in  creative  dance  on  the  social  development  of  preschool  children.  Teachers  and  parents  ratings  of  the  children's  social skills, both before and after the program, revealed  significant  gains  in  social  competence,  suggesting  that  creative  dance  instruction  for  (at-risk)  preschoolers  im- proves  social  interactions  and  behaviour.  Therefore,  dance  might  exist  today  due  to  an  evolutionary  past  in  which it promoted prosocial behaviour, increasing one’s  ability  to  survive  within  ‘primitive’  communities  (Tarr,  Launay, & Dunbar, 2014; Tarr, Launay, Cohen, & Dun- bar, 2015; Bispham, 2006; Merker, Madison, & Eckerdal,  2009; Ravignani, Bowling, & Fitch, 2014).    Key to dance’s ability to engender social affiliation is,  arguably,  its  capacity  to  direct  the  attentional  foci  and  cognitive resources of individuals. Evidence for this, and  its effect upon interpersonal memory, was investigated by  Woolhouse, Tidhar and Cross (2016). In brief, the study  of Woolhouse et al. (2016) required untrained dancers to       Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Ponmanadiyil, R. & Woolhouse, M. H. (2018)  Observation of Bharatanatyam    recall  various  attributes  of  one  another  after  having  danced in groups, some synchronously, others asynchro- nously. Results showed that those who danced together in  time  were  more  likely  to  remember  each  other.  Wool- house  et  al.  hypothesized  that  this  may  facilitate  social  bonding, which would presumably be difficult to achieve  in situations where interpersonal memory was absent. For  recent related research regarding dance and social bond- ing,  see  von  Zimmermann,  Zichary,  Sperling,  Orgs  and  Richardson (2018).   In a related study, Woolhouse and Lai (2014) investi- gated the eye movements of participants observing pairs  of  dancers,  one  of  whom  danced  in  synchrony  with  a  musical  track,  while  the  other  danced  asynchronously.  Gaze dwell-times amongst participants were significantly  greater  for  the  music-synchronous  dancer,  indicating  a  possible  mechanism  through  which  attention  may  have  been directed towards the in-tempo dancers in the group  study of Woolhouse et al. (2016). Moreover, Woolhouse  and  Lai  (2014)  investigated  fixations  across  different  body  regions,  including  head,  torso,  legs  and  feet.  Per- haps, paradoxically, given the importance of legs and feet  in  most  dancing,  feet  attracted  significantly  less  dwell  time than any other body region. In sum, dance, in com- bination with music, appears to have the ability to direct  attention as detected in the eye movements of observers.  This is on par with everyday motion, which also produces  gaze toward the head (Matarić & Pomplun, 1998).   Two  types  of  eye  movements  are  usually  studied  in  scene-perception  research:  fixations,  during  which  the  eyes  remain  still  and  new  information  is  acquired  from  the visual field, and saccades, movements between fixa- tions  during  which  vision  is  suppressed  and  no  new  in- formation is gained (Rayner, 2009). In reading research,  regressions—reverse  saccades  in  which  the  eyes  back- track to the previous fixation point—are frequently exam- ined  in  relation  to  syntactic  comprehension  (Liversedge  &  Findlay,  2000; Rayner,  Chace,  Slattery  &  Ashby,  2006). In scene perception, fixations are usually between  260–330 ms, interspersed with saccades lasting about 50  ms  (Rayner,  2009).  Saccade  lengths  can  differ  signifi- cantly depending on the type of image being viewed, and  are  about  40%  longer  for  complex  natural  scenes  than  abstract patterns (Andrews & Coppola, 1999).   While  several  individuals  may  observe  the  same  dance,  various  studies  indicate  that  how  each  individual  completes  this  potentially  cognitively  demanding  task   depends upon context and experience. For instance, Van  Den  Bosch,  Salimpoor  and  Zatorre  (2013)  found  that  emotional arousal increases upon repeated exposure to a  musical  piece,  suggesting  that,  in  general,  familiarity  influences cognition, possibly by allowing individuals to  develop  schematic  expectations;  see  also  Orgs,  Hagura  and Haggard (2013). And while, since the early 1970’s, it  has been known that expertise and familiarity of the static  visual  stimuli  significantly  influences  eye  movements  (e.g.  Kundel  &  La  Follette,  1972),  it  was  only  in  the  1990’s  that  researchers  thoroughly  investigated  how  expectations  influence  human  motion  perception.  For  example, individuals’ schema of biological motion guides  them to fixate on the ends of limbs to track the movement  of human extremities (Matarić & Pomplun, 1998).   With respect to dance, in a study examining the influ- ence of expertise on the observation of dance, Stevens et  al. (2010) found that people with advanced dance training  had  shorter  fixation  durations  and  faster  saccades  than  novices.  In  their  analysis  of  body-directed  fixations,  the  experienced  choreographer  in  the  study  attended  mostly  to the head of the dancers, while novices attended equally  to the head, neck, torso and arms. Stevens et al. suggested  that the eye movements of the expert in their study was  “likely guided by the expectancies and schemata in long- term  memory”,  and  that  this  was  due  to  them  being  “adept at abstracting and extracting key information from  complex  movement  material”  (p.  23).  Which  is  to  say,  fixations and saccades are influenced by the type of im- age being viewed and expertise that, in turn, are sugges- tive  of  viewers’  underlying  cognitive  processes,  atten- tional  foci,  and  schematic  knowledge.  The  differences  between  experts  and  novices  found  by  Stevens  et  al.  (2010)  are  consistent  with  the  earlier  findings  of  Jean,  Cadopi  and  Ille  (2001)  who  found  the  performance  of  expert dancers on a dance sequence recall task depended  in part on the amount of structure in the material, which  implied that subject’s knowledge base impacted memori- zation.  For  related  neurological  research  see  Jola  et  al.  (2013).   Common to the work of Stevens, Woolhouse and oth- ers (e.g. Luck et al., 2010) is the treatment of dance as a  relatively  abstract  form  of  human  movement,  seemingly  divorced  from  its  richer  cultural  setting  in  which,  for  example, narrative meaning may be conveyed; although,  see  Chua,  Boland  and  Nisbett  (2005)  for  the  effect  of  culture on eye movements during scene perception. The      2       Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Ponmanadiyil, R. & Woolhouse, M. H. (2018)  Observation of Bharatanatyam    influence that narrative contexts can have on perception,  and, in particular, eye movements, has recently received  increased  attention.  Loschky,  Larson,  Magliano  and  Smith (2015) studied the relationship between film view- ers’  eye  movements  and  their  comprehension  of  film  narrative  by  investigating  whether  eye  movements  dif- fered  based  on  understanding.  Referred  to  as  the mental  model hypothesis, this notion is distinct from the alterna- tive  tyranny  of  film  hypothesis,  which  stipulates  that  differences  due  to  understanding  are  overwhelmed  by  viewers’ attentional synchrony.    In brief, Loschky et al. (2015) presented two groups  with  a  short  clip  from  a  James  Bond  movie  in  which  a  villain  (“Jaws”)  was  about  to  fall  from  the  sky  onto  a  circus tent. Critically, one group saw only the clip while  the other saw the preceding two-and-a-half minutes of the  movie.  The  researchers  hypothesized  that  the  second  group,  who  viewed  the  clip  with  its  narrative  context,  would be better able to draw critical inferences and have  more  coherent  perceptions  than  the  group  who  viewed  only the short clip. However, despite the difference in the  stimuli, both groups showed strong attentional synchrony,  and only small between-group variance. Overall, then, the  results  of  Loschky  et  al.  (2015)  were  more  consistent  with the tyranny of film hypothesis than the mental model  hypothesis,  suggesting  that  narrative  context  may  con- tribute less to eye movements than visual features such as  flicker  and  motion  (i.e.  temporal  contrast)  during  free- viewing of videos; see also Mital, Smith, Hill and Hen- derson (2011); Batten and Smith (2018).   Our intention in this eye-tracking study was to devel- op some of the research discussed above in an experiment  that examined the effects of expertise and dance narrative  on eye movements—that is, dances which, through vari- ous  gesture  sequences,  attempt  to  convey  specific,  real- world and/or religious meanings. To preempt our hypoth- eses somewhat, we envisaged that the difference between  experts  and  novices  would  lead  to  differences  in  eye  movements. One such dance that lends itself particularly  well to this is Indian Bharatanatyam dance. As discussed  above,  while  prior  eye-tracking  studies  have  identified  several  factors  that  influence  the  processing  of  dance— such as expertise—these factors have yet to be explored  within  broader  cultural  contexts.  Our  study  sought  to  provide an expanded cultural understanding of the effects  of  expertise  on  observing  dance  using  videos  of  Bha- ratanatyam.    Bharatanatyam  Originating  in  the  southern  states  of  India,  Bha- ratanatyam  is  an  ancient  form  of  female  classical  dance  that  involves  extensive  formal  training,  passed  from  teacher  to  student  through  years  of  mentorship,  dedica- tion,  and  practice.  The  Natyasastra  scriptures  explain  Bharatanatyam  with  reference  to  a  taxonomy  of  body  movements:  nritta  (abstract,  ‘pure’  dance,  performed  without  expressing  a  particular  theme  or  emotion),  and  nritya (representational, interpretive dance, performed to  convey  emotions  and  narrative  themes);  see  Soneji  (2012) for a detailed explanation. Both nritta and nritya  are produced by a combination of movements and posi- tions involving the feet, limbs, and body, along with hand  gestures and facial expressions. These elements constitute  the ‘lexicon’ of Bharatanatyam, are highly codified, and  are  responsible  for  its  distinctive  look  (along  with  its  brightly coloured, traditional costumes).   One  way  in  which  nritta  and  nritya  can  be  distin- guished  is  through  the  facial  expressions  of  the  danc- ers. Nritta is predominantly performed with a smile, and,  despite  eye  movements,  the  face  has  a  fix,  somewhat  mask-like  quality.  In  nritya,  multiple  dynamic  facial  expressions can be enacted by the dancer as they portray  contrasting  emotions,  characters  and  themes.  A  further  distinction  is  the  use  of  particular  hand  gestures  and  shapes,  referred  to  as  hastas  (or  sometimes  mudras).  During nritta, hastas convey no meaning and are entirely  decorative.  In  nritya,  hastas  in  combination  with  eye  movements and facial expressions can be used to describe  objects,  communicate  concepts  (e.g.  truth  and  beauty),  and  illustrate  thoughts,  actions,  and  emotions.  In  short,  within  Bharatanatyam  there  are  passages  that  are  com- prised entirely of abstract, ‘pure dance’ gestures (nritta),  whilst  others  are  wholly  interpretive  and/or  representa- tional (nritya).    Lastly,  although  there  are  different  styles  of  Bha- ratanatyam,  being  taught  in  varying  schools,  the  differ- ences  in  style  lead  to  only  slight  variations  in  rules,  forms,  and  steps.  Which  is  to  say,  Bharatanatyam  con- forms to a general set of choreographic rules that span the  art form. For example, such requirements include that, in  general, a dance step be completed three times, and that  movements  are  executed  on  the  right  side  of  the  body  before  being  duplicated  on  the  left.  As  these  rules  are  common  across  Bharatanatyam,  it  can  be  assumed  that  dancers  with  at  least  five  years  of  training  will  have  an      3       Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Ponmanadiyil, R. & Woolhouse, M. H. (2018)  Observation of Bharatanatyam    adequate  understanding  of  all  the  basics  movements  of  Bharatanatyam;  however,  more  experience  (e.g.  a  mini- mum  of  eight  years)  is  usually  required  before  an  indi- vidual is considered to be an expert within the discipline.   Hypotheses  The present study builds in part upon the work of Ste- vens  et  al.  (2010)  and  Woolhouse  and  Lai  (2014)  by  using  eye-tracking  to  investigate  the  following  four  hy- potheses:  (1)  that  experts  (of  Bharatanatyam)  will  have  shorter  fixations  than  novices,  which,  if  true,  would  be  consistent  with  the  notion  that  experienced  viewers  ob- serve dance more efficiently (as proposed by Stevens et  al.); (2) that there will be differences in eye movements  while  observing  narrative  dance  versus  non-narrative  dance,  and  possibly  an  interaction  between  the  type  of  dance  (narrative  versus  non-narrative)  and  expertise,  reflecting  differences  in  veridical  knowledge;  (3)  that  more fixations (and greater gaze dwell times) will occur  in  relation  to  the  upper  body  than  lower  (as  found  by  Woolhouse  and  Lai,  2014);  and  (4)  that  there  will  be  greater attentional similarity between experts than novic- es  due  to  the  influence  of  shared  schematic  knowledge  concerning Bharatanatyam.    A description of the study’s methods (including par- ticipants, stimuli, apparatus, procedure, and analysis), and  results now follows.   Methods   no   possessing   Participants  28  female  undergraduate  psychology  students  and  volunteers  participated  in  the  study.  Participants  were  categorized  into  Bharatanatyam  experts—individuals  possessing  at  least  eight  years  of  formal  training—and  novices—individuals  or  knowledge  of  Bharatanatyam.  The  decision  to  include  only  female  participants  was  taken  due  to  a  preponder- ance  of  females  amongst  the  expert  cohort;  in  order  to  maintain balance, female participants were therefore also  used  within  the  novice  cohort.  There  were  14  experts  (mean  age  =  18.81  years;  SD  =  1.03)  and  14  novices  (mean age = 18.92 years; SD = .53). Experts possessed a  mean  of  9.55  years  of  Bharatanatyam  training  (SD  =  1.03),  and  commenced  training  at  about  5  years  of  age.  Novices  had  no  formal  training  in  any  dance  form,  and   training   reported  that  they  had  no  knowledge  of  Bharatanatyam,  nor  had  they  previously  seen  it  performed.  All  partici- pants  had  normal  or  corrected-to-normal  eyesight.  Each  participant provided informed consent prior to the exper- iment;  student  participants  were  compensated  with  a  single course credit. All procedures involving the partici- pants were consistent with Canadian Tri-Council Policy;  the study had ethics clearance from the Research Ethics  Board of the host institution.    Materials  The primary stimuli for this eye-tracking experiment  were  taken  from  a  solo  Bharatanatyam  dance  perfor- mance  (Arangetram),  presented  in  front  of  a  live  audi- ence by the first author in November 2011. A collection  of  dance  pieces,  each  ranging  in  length  from  10  to  20  minutes,  were  selected  and  trimmed  into  sixteen  video  clips,  each  approximately  30  seconds  in  duration.  Eight  of  the  videos  presented  Bharatanatyam  dance  that  was  narrative  in  nature  (nritya),  while  the  remaining  eight  videos were non-narrative (nritta). For the narrative vide- os, selections were made such that each video portrayed a  storyline or specific character. The stage, stage lighting,  camera  angle,  and  dancer’s  costume  were  consistent  across the video clips; see Figure 1.   Carnatic  music,  an  Indian  classical  music  genre,  ac- companied  the  videos  and  was  performed  by  a  small  ensemble of musicians to the right of the dancer on stage;  however,  the  ensemble  was  not  visible  in  the  videos.  Carnatic music consists of two main elements: rāga, the  melodic-scalic  component  of  the  music,  and  tāḷa,  the  rhythmic cycles (Bhagyalekshmy, 1990). The music used  for  the  narrative  and  non-narrative  had  a  neutral  mood,  and did not differ with respect to valence (i.e., was nei- ther overtly positive nor negative in affect). The specific  rāgas, tāḷas, and whether the video was narrative or non- narrative are shown in Table 1.    Apparatus  Eye movements were recorded using a Mirametrix S2  Eye  Tracker  at  a  sampling  rate  of  60  Hz  for  each  eye;  only  data  recorded  from  the  right  eye  were  used  in  the  subsequent  analyses.  Blinks  were  linearly  interpolated  using  the  system’s  eye-tracking  software.  The  bright- pupil tracking system (sometimes referred to as “red eye  effect”,  caused  by  on-camera-axis  illumination;  see  Holmqvist et al. (2011), for detailed summary) had a 0.5-     4       Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Ponmanadiyil, R. & Woolhouse, M. H.

Video  stimuli  were  presented  to  participants  on  a  27”  monitor  with  a  resolution of 1920 x 1080. The eye-tracker equipment sat  unobtrusively  below  the  monitor,  facing  the  user.  An  artificially  lit  booth  surrounded  the  monitor  and  partici- pant  to  minimize  glare  and  distraction.  Music  was  pre- sented through AKG K 172 HD headphones, and set to a  comfortable level by each participant prior to calibrating  the eye-tracker. All participants’ data was exported with  the system’s EyeMetrix Software (Mirametrix Inc.).    observe the dances in no specific manner, but simply to  relax  and  watch  the  videos  as  if  viewing  under  normal  conditions. Participants were also instructed to tap along  to  the  underlying  beat  of  the  music  using  the  computer  mouse.  This  relatively  undemanding  task  ensured  that  participants  attended  to  both  the  visual  and  acous- tic/musical  elements  of  the  stimuli;  in  most  cases,  indi- viduals  tend  to  seek  out  and  move  synchronously  (and  sometimes  spontaneously)  to  an  observed  beat  (Sebanz,  Bekkering, & Knoblich, 2006; Burger, Saarikallio, Luck,  Thompson,  &  Toiviainen,  2013).  The  video-watching  portion  of  the  experiment  lasted  approximately  12  minutes.   Table 1. Dance title, rāga, and dance type associated with each  video  (#).

Procedure  Participants completed a questionnaire regarding their  formal  dance  and  music-training experiences. Following  a  9-point  eye-tracking  calibration  process,  the  16  video  stimuli  were  presented  in  a  randomized  order  unique  to  each  participant.  A  black  screen  appeared  for  three  se- conds between each video. Participants were instructed to     Analysis  In order to reduce “jitter” and “flicker” effects of the  eye-tracking  system,  and  possible  artifacts  of  its  data- parsing algorithm, fixations below 100 ms were omitted  from the analysis; this resulted in approximately 10% of  the data being lost. For discussion on the relative merits  of  omitting  fixation  durations  below  a  certain  threshold  and  data-processing  algorithms,  see  Wass,  Smith  and  Johnson  (2013).  In  terms  of  raw  data,  each  participant  produced a single data file which contained all their fixa- tion information for all videos. These data files contained  the  following  columns:  Observation  number,  Frame  number, Time stamp, X and Y positions for both Left and      5       Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Ponmanadiyil, R. & Woolhouse, M. H. (2018)  Observation of Bharatanatyam    Right  eyes,  and  Pupil  diametre  information.  The  frame  number  and  time  stamp  column  were  linked  such  that  each  frame  equated  to  16.66  milliseconds  (i.e.  60  Hz).  The total number of observations (i.e. rows) per partici- pant data file was in the region of 35,000. We requested,  from  the  eye-tracking  analytical  software,  data  frames  which consisted only of fixations greater than 100 ms (as  mentioned  above),  the  x-  and  y-  coordinates,  and  time  stamp information.   Repeated-measure   three-way  mixed  analyses  of  variance  (ANOVA),  with Dance-type  and  Region  of  Interest (ROI) as within-subject factors, and Expertise as  between-subject  factor,  were  run  separately  on  two  dependent  variables:  fixation  duration  and  dwell  time.  The data frame for these analyses consisted of 112 rows  and 7 columns with the following headings: Subject ID;  Expertise;  Dance-type;  ROI;  Mean  fixation  percentage;  Fixation  duration  SD;  Dwell  time  percentage.  Within  Expertise there were two levels, expert and novice. There  were  also  two  levels  within  Dance-type:  narrative  and  non-narrative.  ROI  consisted  of  the  screen  horizontally  divided into two fixed, equally sized regions: top, which  covered  the  dancer’s  upper  body,  and  bottom,  covering  the dancer’s lower body. It should be noted that this split  did  not  absolutely,  nor  consistently,  divide  the  dancer’s  body  into  two  equal  parts  (i.e.  head/torso/arms  and  hips/legs/feet)  due  to  the  movement  of  the  dancer.  Expertise and Dance-type with respect to average fixation  duration per participant for each factor combination were  used  to  investigate  Hypotheses  (1)  and  (2);  ROI  in  relation to percentage dwell time was used to investigate  Hypothesis (3).   In  order  to  investigate  Hypothesis  (4)—that  experts  will have greater attentional synchrony due to the influ- ence  of  shared  schematic  knowledge—each  video  was  divided  into  overlapping  time  windows  of  1,000  ms,  succeeding by 500 ms, producing a total of 60 time win- dows per video. Fixations were only included in the time  windows  in  which  they  began,  not  in  subsequent  time  windows.  Thus,  if  a  fixation  began  in  Window  1  and  ended in Window 2, its position data was only included  in  Window  1,  not  2.  Each  fixation  was  associated  with  positional coordinates (x, y) with which average SDs for  x and y fixation positions were calculated, and then used  to  calculate  average  fixation  position  SDs.  The  fixation  position SDs of each 1,000 ms time window, correspond- ing to each video, were analyzed using a repeat-measure   two-way  ANOVA,  with  Expertise  as  a  between-subject  factor and Dance-type as within-subject factors. Outliers,  i.e.  a  data  point  outside  1.5  times  the  interquartile  range  above  the  upper  quartile  and  below  the  lower  quartile, were removed from this analysis. This resulted  in a core data set consisting of 1898 rows and 8 columns  with the following headings: Expertise; Semantics; Video  ID; Window ID; Window start time; Average SD, x-axis;  Average  SD,  y-axis;  Average  SD,  x-  and  y-axes.  This  analysis also enabled us to further test Hypothesis (2)— that  there  will  be  differences  in  eye  movements  while  observing narrative versus non-narrative dance.   All data were analyzed using the open-source statisti- cal  package  R  (2.15.0,  GUI  1.51).  MATLAB  (R2014)  was used to calculate the fixation SDs per time window  per  video.  Effect  sizes  are  reported  with  partial  eta- squared values.   Results    Fixation duration  There  was  a  significant  main  effect  of  Expertise  [F(1,72)  =  6.478, p <  0.05,  η²  =  0.009],  and  of  ROI  [F(1,72) = 4.315, p < 0.05, η² = 0.008], but not of Dance- type (F < 1). Expert participants had significantly shorter  fixation  durations  (see  Figure  2);  participants’ fixation durations were significantly greater  when  observing  the  top  of  the  screen  versus  the  bottom  (see Figure 3).  Whether the dance was narrative or non- narrative  had  no  effect  on  fixation  duration.  No  significant  interactions  were  found  between  the  factors  (F <  1),  and  excluding  outliers  did  not  affect  the  significance of the results.   than  novices   Dwell time  There was a significant main effect of ROI [F(1,72) =  51.424, p <  0.001;  η²  =  0.054],  but  not  of  Expertise  or  Dance-type (F < 1). Participants spent significantly more  time observing the top part of the screen (see Figure 4),  irrespective of whether they were experts or novices, or  whether  the  dance  was  narrative  or  non-narrative  in  nature.  The  non-significant  result  for  Expertise  and  Dance-type  was  not  surprising  given  that  experts  and  novices viewed all narrative and non-narrative videos for  an equal length of time. No significant interactions were  found between the factors (F < 1), and excluding outliers  did not affect the significance of the results.      6       Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Ponmanadiyil, R. & Woolhouse, M.

This finding is consistent with the  heat maps generated for experts and novices (Figure 6). A  significant  main  effect  of  Dance-type  was  also  found  [F(1,1890) = 4.693, p < 0.05, η² = 0.002]; non-narrative  stimuli yielded larger fixation-position SDs than narrative  stimuli  (see  Figure  7).

Notched  boxplots  of  mean  fixation  position  SD  per  time window for Dance-type (non-narrative and narrative).   Discussion   This study explored the extent to which expertise and  narrative content influenced the eye movements of people  observing  Bharatanatyam  dance.  Two  dependent  varia- bles were measured, fixation duration and dwell time. A  further  analysis  calculated  the  dispersion  of  fixations  within 1,000 ms time windows, advancing in increments  of 500 ms. Despite the relatively small eta squared effect  values, the analyses determined that expert viewers pos- sessed  greater  attentional  similarity  than  novices:  lower  fixation-position  SDs  within  a  given  time  period  are  indicative  of  greater  fixation  alignment,  and  thus  in- creased attentional similarity.    The above was conducted in order to test four related  hypotheses. Hypothesis (1)—that novices will have long- er  fixations  than  experts—was  supported  by  the  data:  experts  in  our  study  did  have  shorter  fixation  durations  than  novices,  suggesting  that  the  inexperienced  partici- pants observed the dance videos less efficiently (Figure  2). This result is consistent with the findings of Stevens et  al. (2010), who reported a similar effect in their novice- expert dance study. However, while Stevens et al. con- centrated  on  western  contemporary  dance,  our  study  sought to expand and/or generalize this effect to a very  different cultural tradition, i.e. classical dance of southern  India.      8       Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Ponmanadiyil, R. & Woolhouse, M. H. (2018)  Observation of Bharatanatyam    Hypothesis  (2)—that  narrative  dance  versus  non- narrative  dance  will  produce  differences  in  eye  move- ments—was not supported by the fixation-duration data,  which  showed  no  statistical  differences  within  factor  Dance-type.  This  hypothesis  was  based  on  previous  re- search  that  even  in  the  absence  of  any  visual  stimuli,  contextual  information  influences  oculomotor  responses  (Spivey,  Tyler,  Richardson,  &  Young,  2000).  Prior  to  conducting the experiment, we had speculated that longer  fixation durations might occur for the narrative videos as  these  dances  contain  richer  semantic  information,  and  thus,  arguably,  require  greater  attention;  however,  this  was not the case in this instance. That said, a significant  effect of  Dance-type was observed when the dependent  variable  was  fixation  position  SD  (Figure  7).  Whether  this effect was genuinely cognitive (e.g. involving differ- ent attentional resources or processes), or simply due to  the  dancer  moving  more  in  the  non-narrative  videos  is,  however,  uncertain—dynamic  video-contrast  analysis  (e.g.  as  conducted  by  Mital  et  al.,  2011)  would  be  re- quired in order to answer this point definitively. Be that  as it may, given that we are uncertain as to the cause of  the  effect  of  Dance-type  on  fixation  position  SD,  the  findings above cannot be said to support the conclusions  of  Loschky  et  al.  (2015),  discussed  in  the  Introduction;  namely, that narrative contexts may contribute less to eye  movements than visual features such as motion (i.e. tem- poral contrast) during free-viewing of videos.   Hypothesis  (3)—that  greater  gaze  dwell  times  will  occur  in  relation  to  the  upper  body—was  conclusively  found to be the case (Figure 4). This result strongly aligns  with  the  findings  of  Woolhouse  and  Lai  (2014),  who,  perhaps  counter-intuitively,  found  that  the  feet  of  the  dancer  in  their  experiment  attracted  the  least  fixations.  Feet  are  arguably  a  dancer’s  greatest  asset  (Macaulay,  2009);  it  could  be  considered  paradoxically,  then,  that  when  observing  dance,  we  seem  to  spend  the  least  amount  of  time  fixating  on  this  part  of  the  body.  That  said,  an  important  confound  should  be  mentioned.  In  scene  viewing,  gaze  direction  can  be  predicted  using  a  combination of saliency and face detection (Judd, Ehing- er,  Durand,  &  Torralba,  2009),  both  of  which  do  not  depend on whether the scene involves dance. The effects  of saliency and face detection significantly bias the upper  screen area, in which the face of our dancer was almost  invariably located. As a result, no significant conclusions  can be made regarding whether dance per se specifically  directs attention towards the head.   An interesting finding concerning factor ROI was that  fixation durations were significantly shorter for the lower  versus  upper  part  of  the  dancer’s  body  (Figure  3).  We  confess  to  being  somewhat  puzzled  by  this,  although  it  could be related to the fact that participants spent signifi- cantly less time observing the lower part of the dancer’s  body (Figure 4). Maybe, observers genuinely find danc- ers’  legs  and  feet  less  interesting  (or,  at  least,  informa- tionally  impoverished  relative  to  the  upper  body  and  head),  in  which  case,  when  their  gaze  is  drawn  down- wards,  a  vertical  saccade  abruptly  directs  foveal  vision  upwards.  Recent  research  supports  this  conjecture;  Vicary,  Sperling,  von  Zimmermann,  Richardson,  and  Orgs (2017) found that dance communicates group coor- dination  through  combined  movement  dynamics  within  groups of performers. They showed that movement syn- chrony among a group of performers predicts the aesthet- ic appreciation of live dance performances. Vicary et al.  (2017)  concluded that their findings were  in  accordance  with  the  evolutionary  function  of  dance  in  transmitting  social signals between people through human movement.  Hypothesis  (4)—that  experts  will  have  greater  atten- tional  similarity—was  supported  by  the  data:  the  fixa- tions of the Experts in our study were, in general, more  tightly  clustered  than  Novices’  fixations,  both  spatially  and temporally (Figures 5). This is particularly noticeable  in the dwell time heat maps in Figure 6: the lower image  (novices)  clearly  has  a  larger  and  more  diffuse  gaze- pattern  relative  to  the  upper  (experts).  This  result  lends  support to the conjecture of Stevens et al. (2010), referred  to  in  the  Introduction,  that  experienced  observers  of  dance  have  choreographic  schemata  stored  in  long-term  memory,  which  enables  them  to  target  their  attention  towards  (shared)  salient  elements  within  the  dance.  In  turn, this results in a higher degree of attentional similari- ty  between  participants,  as  expressed  in  fixation- dispersion  data.  Conversely,  inexperienced  viewers  pro- duce more scattered fixations as they (variously) attempt  to  make  sense  of  and  predict  the  dancer’s  movements.  Interestingly, within Bharatanatyam, hand movements are  generally  considered  more  important  than  leg  move- ments, a fact which would have been known to our expert  participants,  but  not  novices.  Therefore,  although  the  above finding may be due, in part, to dance schemata, the  possibility  that  explicit  Bharatanatyam  knowledge  may  have also influenced our results cannot be ruled out.       9       Journal of Eye Movement Research  11(2):11, 1–12   Ponmanadiyil, R. & Woolhouse, M. H. (2018)  Observation of Bharatanatyam    The fact that our video stimuli were based on exam- ples  of  Bharatanatyam  has  both  benefits  and  drawbacks  from an experimental perspective. A particular benefit of  using  excerpts  from  an  authentic  Bharatanatyam  perfor- mance was that they provided the study with a degree of  ecological  validity—the  stimuli  were  not  unduly  con- trolled or contrived, nor stripped of their cultural richness  as expressed in the dancer’s costume and the accompany- ing  Carnatic  music.  It  is  legitimate  to  claim,  therefore,  that our data, however imperfect, were at least produced  in  response  to  a  real-world  phenomenon,  and  are  thus  potentially applicable or relatable to other similar global  dance practices. For example, future research could simi- larly examine Kathakali, which, like Bharatanatyam, is a  major  form  of classical  Indian  dance  involving  story  telling,  but  which  in  contrast  to  Bharatanatyam  is  pre- dominantly performed by male actor-dancers.    With  respect  to  our  study’s  limitations,  by  including  only  one  dancer,  factors  specific  to  this  individual  not  controlled  for  in  the  experiment  may  have  skewed  our  results.  That  said,  given  the  highly  codified  nature  of  Bharatanatyam, achieved through multiple years of train- ing, it would seem likely that our findings would be rep- licated using other dancers. A further potential drawback,  previously  mentioned,  is  that  our  participants  were  all  female.    Given  that  Bharatanatyam  is  most  commonly  danced by females, experts with this discipline tend also  to  be  female,  if  not  exclusively  so  for  all  practical  pur- poses.  Our desire to avoid a gender imbalance between  the experts and novices naturally led to the exclusion of  male  (novice)  participants,  which  may,  in  itself,  impose  restrictions on the degree to which our results are gener- alizable. One further limitation concerns the interdepend- ence  of  the  music  and  dance—these  two  crucial  factors  were  not  separately  manipulated  and  thus  it  is  possible  that there was an undetected interaction between the two,  i.e.  there  may  have  been  factors  within  the  music  that  interacted with particular gestures, giving rise to specific  eye  movements.  That  said,  as  mentioned  previously,  all  the music was of a similar emotional character and mood,  and  thus  we  believe  it  is  unlikely  that  there  were  any  significant interactions.   Eye-tracking cameras invariably produce a wealth of  data  that  can  be  analyzed  using  systems’  proprietary  software and/or exported to other analytical packages. In  this regard, our decision to concentrate on fixation dura- tions  and  dispersions,  and  dwell  time  may  seem  unduly   restricted:  saccade  and  pupillometric  information  could,  in  theory,  have  also  been  included  in  the  analysis.  Our  reason  for  not  doing  so  was  due  to  the  hypotheses  we  wished to test and their relationship to previous research,  e.g. Stevens et al. (2010) and Woolhouse and Lai (2014).  Certainly,  multiple  additional  statistics  could,  no  doubt,  have been included; the extent to which these would have  enriched or detracted from the study is, however, open to  debate.    Summary   Our aim was to extend to a broader cultural context a  series  of  findings  derived  largely  from  western  dance  (e.g. Woolhouse & Lai, 2014; Luck et al., 2010), and in  this regard the study achieved its main goal. Data con- sistent with three of our four hypotheses were produced  by  stimuli  consisting  of  videos  of  an  actual  Bha- ratanatyam dance performance: experts had shorter fixa- tions and greater attentional similarity; greater gaze dwell  times  occurred  predominantly  in  relation  to  the  upper  body.  Only  one  hypothesis  achieved  limited  support:  fixation  durations  showed  no  difference  between  narra- tive and non-narrative videos, whereas fixation dispersion  patterns did differ. In sum, the study assists in building a  nuanced picture of some of the eye movements associated  with Bharatanatyam, and, in so doing, helps pave the way  for research investigating other non-western dance forms.

Flexibility  and accessibility are the other two important advantages of e- learning.   The authors in [7] have designed a system for recognizing  hand  gestures  of  ‘Bharatanatyam’  Dance  using  orientation  filter [8] [9] and connectivity graph for ‘Asamyukta Hastas’.  There are two major problems for which the algorithm is not  applied on real time images.  First of all, eight  hand gestures  are misclassified because connectivity graphs of nearly similar  hand gestures are equal. Second problem is that, typically the  tips  of  the  fingers  are  coated  with  red  colors  when  ‘Bharatanatyam’  dance  is  performed.  But  in  [7],  skin  color  based segmentation is used to extract boundary of the hands.  After this segmentation the tips of the fingers are removed. So  boundaries  of  the  fingers  are  lost  by  skin  color  based  segmentation. To deal with these two problems, an algorithm  is  proposed  in  this  paper.  First  problem  is  solved  as  the  boundary  of  hand  gesture  is  considered  instead  of  the  connectivity graph. To deal with the second problem, texture  based segmentation is considered instead of skin color based  segmentation.    In this proposed algorithm,  we  have designed a  four level  system. The main difficulty of recognising any hand gesture is  to separate out the hand from the background [10] [11]. Thus  at  the  first  level,  the  hand  is  segmented  out  from  the  background  using  hand  texture  [12]  [13]  [14].  Then  the  boundary  of  the  hand  is  detected  using  Sobel  edge  detection  technique [15] [16] [17] [18]. At the next level, slopes of the  boundaries  are  calculated  and  based  on  this  straight  line  approximation  [19]  [20]  is  done.  Now,  the  straight  lines  are  approximated using 10-sided regular polygon (also known as  decagon)  [21].  Zero  padding  of  the  chain  codes  is  done  to  obtain equal length chain codes for all the 28 hand gestures.  At  the  time  of  matching  same  length  chain  codes  are  advantageous  than  different  length  chain  codes  [22]  .  At  the  final stage, unknown hand gestures are matched with the hand  gestures from the database using the chain codes by similarity  function.  This  algorithm  to  deal  with  translation  invariant  hand  gestures.  The  average  timing  complexity of the proposed algorithm is 3.312 sec in an Intel   implemented   is   Abstract—For  automatic  hand  gesture  recognition  of  ‘Bharatanatyam’  dance,  a  4-stage  system  has  been  designed.  In  the  first  stage,  texture  based  segmentation  is  done  to  detect  the  hand of the dancer from the background. Thus boundary of the  hand  is  extracted.  In  the  next  stage,  boundary  of  the  hand  is  approximated  using  straight  lines.  Now  at  the  third  stage,  each  straight  line  is  represented  by  the  sides  of  a  decagon  by  comparing the slopes and thus a chain code is obtained from this.  In the last level, matching of an unknown chain code is done with  the  chain  codes  from  the  database  with  an  accuracy  rate  of  89.3%. This simple yet effective code is very useful for e-learning  of ‘Bharatanatyam’ dance. It is a fast and effective way to spread  the dance form world-wide.

INTRODUCTION   is   its   (hand   ‘Bharatanatyam’  is  one  of  the  popular  dances  and  widely  performed  in  world-wide.  It  originated  from  Tamil  Nadu,  a  south  Indian  state.  This  traditional  dance  form  signifies  elegance,  purity  and  grace.  An  essential  element  of  ‘Bharatanatyam’  ‘mudras’  or  movements).  ‘Hastas’ signifies different hand symbols that a  dancer  use  to  communicate.  ‘Hastas’  can  be  of  two  types  ‘Asamyukta  Hastas’  (single  hand)  and  ‘Samyukta  Hastas’  (double hand). ‘Asamyukta Hastas’ consists of 28 mudras and  ‘Samyukta Hastas’ consists of 24 mudras.    ‘Hastas’   Like  normal  hand  gestures  [1],  ‘Bharatanatyam’  hand  gestures  are  expressive  and  meaningful.  Interaction  between  dancers  is  achieved  by  the  hand  gestures.  ‘Pathakam’  hand  gesture  stands  for  joy,  whereas  ‘Mrigasirsham’  is  used  to  denote fear. Various meanings are indicated by different hand  gestures.   With the increasing popularity of internet, it is  very  much  useful to identify hand gestures of the ‘Bharatanatyam’ dance  using computers [2] [3] [4]. The objective of this paper is to  develop  a  simple  system  for  promoting  e-learning  of  ‘Bharatanatyam’  dance  [5]  [6].  Thus  the  ‘Bharatanatyam’  learning  becomes  an  interactive  program  between  the  dancer  and the computer.

For  Sobel  edge  detection  technique,  a  3×3  neighbourhood is taken into account as explained in Fig. 1.       II.  PROPOSED ALGORITHM   Fig. 1.  Labelling of neighbourhood pixels       The steps of the proposed algorithm are explained in here in   details.   A.  Boundary Extraction   One  of  the  important  aspects  of  gesture  recognition  is  to  identify  the  hand  of  the  dancer  from  the  background.  In  [7],  the  authors  are  using  skin-color  based  segmentation  for  separating  the  hand  from  the  background.  But  it  has  two  drawbacks  already  stated.  So  texture  base  segmentation  is  applied  to  eliminate  unnecessary  information  about  the  background.    The  input  RGB  image  is  first  converted  to  grey-scale  image. Here the values are in the range of 0 (for black) and 1  (for white). Then we apply texture based segmentation in this  image  and  converted  to  binary  image  (BW)  by  calculating  entropy   For  texture  based  segmentation  [12]  [13]  [14]  entropy  calculation is used [23]. This stage is the first pre-processing  for  hand  gesture  recognition.  It  requires  finite  stage  neighbourhood  for  processing.  First  the  gray-level  co- occurrence  matrix is obtained using a displacement vector  d.  Here  it  is  specified  as  (1,1),  which  means  one  pixel  to  right  and one pixel below.   =  =     ,  (  )       dx  dy  )1,1(  d   P[i,j] is not necessarily symmetric. Each element of P[i,j] is  divided  by  total  no  of  pixel  pairs  to  obtain  normalize  value.  This normalized P[i,j] is known as probability mass function.  Entropy is calculated based on P[i,j].                           (1)   Entropy  (cid:166)(cid:166)−=  i  j  iP log],[  j  ip j ],[                           (2)   Entropy values which are greater than a threshold value 0.7  are  selected. The  output  image  has  1  value  for  all  the  pixels  which  have  greater  value  than  0.7  or  0  otherwise.  This  threshold value is taken empirically.    BW  ,1 (cid:173)= (cid:174) ,0 (cid:175)          if  pixel  7.0>  otherwise              (3)   Now  the  edges  are  smoothed  and  open  holes  are  closed.  Here the neighbourhood value is taken same as the value used  for  entropy  calculation.  Then  the  boundary  of  the  hand  is   Partial  derivatives  are  calculated  by  the  following  two   equations   sx  =  (  a  2  +  ca 3  +  a  4  )  −  (  a  0  +  ca 7  +  a  6  )                        (4)   sy  =  (  a  0  +  ca 1  +  a  2  )  −  (  a  6  +  ca  5  +  a  4  )              (5)   where c is a constant.  Magnitude, M is measured by (6)   M       =  s  2 x  +  s  2 y                          (6)    Smoothing  of  the  edges  is done  to  obtain  better result  in  the  next  stage.  Here  smoothing  is  done  by  morphological  shrink  [24] [25] operation  to one  value. The boundary  of  the  hand  gesture  in  some  places  are  thicken,  so  to  remove  the  unwanted pixels from the boundary and produce a single pixel  bounded line, morphological shrink operation is implemented.     B.  Straight Line Approximation   The boundary of the hand gesture is a curved line, but for  generation of chain code by polygon representation, we need a  straight line approximated boundary [19] [20]. For this reason,  the two end points of the image are extracted. Then  we start  from one end point (which is at the left side from the other end  point) and its adjoining 8 pixels are examined. This continues  until the other end point is reached.   The entire boundary is represented using connected straight  lines.  This  is  done  by  first  calculating  the  slopes  of  adjacent  pixels and then detecting the point where there is a change of  slope.  Then  these  points  are  connected  using  straight  lines.  Thus we get a straight line representation of the image where  the shape of the boundary is kept intact.   Our  goal  is  to  represent  the  boundary  using  minimum  possible straight lines so as to reduce the noise by keeping the  shape of the image undistorted. To smooth the image further,  at  first  those  points  which  are  very  near  to  each  other,  i.e.,  those  points  which  are  joined  by  straight  lines  having  very  small  length  are  discarded,  i.e.,  straight  lines  having  length  less than a particular threshold value are discarded. This value  is chosen such that it discards maximum possible straight lines  without  affecting  the  shape  of  the  boundary.  In  this  case  the  threshold value is empirically chosen as 15.     2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Energy & Communication(CIEC)   565  Next the slope of each straight line is determined. Starting  from the first straight line, its slope is compared to its adjacent  connected straight lines. If the difference between the slopes is  within  a  particular  range  then  the  latter  is  discarded  and  the  next  straight  line  is  compared  to  the  first  one.  Here  also,  the  range  is  chosen  such  that  it  discards  the  maximum  possible  number  of  straight  lines  keeping  the  shape  of  the  boundary  more or less intact. In this case the range is taken to be -40o to  +40o, which is also determined experimentally.       C.  Polygon Representation and Chain Code Generation   Arbitrary geometric structures can be encoded by a number  of  ways,  each  having  its  own  particular  advantages  and  disadvantages  [22].  One  such  method  is  to  represent  the  straight lines by the edges of a regular polygon. Here we are  using regular decagon to generate chain code. More will be the  side  of  the  regular  polygon;  complexity  of  the  code  will  be  more, thus increasing timing complexity. But with lesser no of  sides  of  regular  polygon,  information  about  different  slopes  will be lost. The straight lines which have a large difference in  slope will be approximated by same side of polygon. Thus we  are taking 10-sided polygon for representing the straight line  approximated boundary by a chain code.         Fig. 2.  Decagon showing internal and external angles   At  first  each  straight  line  of  the  boundary  of  the  hand  gesture is divided into a number of segments. This is done so  that the length of the code generated for each image is more or  less uniform. Here segment length is taken as 30 pixels. Let a  straight line has 62 pixels length and it is approximated using  polygon edge 1, so the code is 111.   Next  the  slope  of  each  segment  is  calculated  and  stored.  Now  a  10-sided  regular  polygon  is  considered  with  one  side  parallel to the x-axis. The slopes of its ten sides are calculated.  Since  we  are  considering  a  regular  polygon,  so  two  sides  of  the polygon have same slope. The sides 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and  8, 4 and 9, 5 and 10 are parallel, having same slopes as shown  in  Fig.  2.  All  the  internal  angles  of  decagon  [21]  are  1440  according to (7).          Interior  _  angle  ×−= n 2  n  0  180                              (7)       The exterior angles of sides 1 to 5 are 360, 720, 1080, 1440  and 1800 respectively as shown in fig. 6.   Now  we  compare  the  slope  of  each  straight  line  of  the  image with the slopes of the sides of the polygon. If the slope  of  the  straight  line  matches  more  or  less  with  side  1  of  the  polygon, then its code is 1. Likewise if the slope matches more  or less with side 2 of the polygon its code is 2 according to (8).  The code for a specific straight line is 1 if its slope is greater  than 180, but less than equal to 540. Here 540 is taken as it is  the  average  of  360  and  720.  In  this  way  the  codes  of  each  individual straight line constituting the image are determined  and  combining  them  a  complete  code  is  generated  for  each  boundary of the hand gestures.   Code  =  if if if if if  < 18 < 54 < 90 < 126 < 152  ≤ slope 54 ≤ slope 90 ≤ slope 126 ≤ slope 152 ≤ slope 180      1 (cid:173) (cid:176) 2 (cid:176)(cid:176) 3 (cid:174) (cid:176) 4 (cid:176) 5 (cid:176) (cid:175)                   or  0  < slope  ≤  18 (8)   The length of the code depends on the number of straight  lines  used  to  smooth  the  image,  as  well  as  on the  number  of  segments into which each straight line is divided.   D.  Matching of Hand Gestures   Whenever, an unknown posture is detected, its boundary is  calculated  and  chain  code  using  polygon  approximation  is  produced. Now the chain code is scaled to obtain equal length  code like the plots from the database. For scaling purpose, all  the code lengths are made to 31. As we have found the largest  code  length  is  31  for  all  the  experimented  images.  If  a  code  obtain is of length x, then (31 − x) no of zeros are added to the  end  of  the  code  to  form  equal  length  chain  codes.  The  unknown  code  is  matched  with  all  the  28  codes  from  the  database.  The  difference  of  the  chain  codes  is  taking  as  the  error function. The best matched gesture is having least error  value. Now this best matched gesture is taken as the output.    =  S  arg  min  31  (cid:170) (cid:166)∀ (cid:171) (cid:172)  = 1  28  =  q  p  { Code  −  Code  known  unknown  (cid:186) }(cid:187) (cid:188)          (9)   where S is the similarity function, which returns argument  based  on  unknown  code  (Codeunknown)  and  known  code  (Codeknown)  for  28  hand  primitives  already  present  in  the  database.  31  is  the  maximum  code  length  possible,  which  is  known empirically.    So  the  proposed  algorithm  easily  identifies  any  unknown  gesture.  The  input  hand  gesture  images  need  not  to  be    2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Energy & Communication(CIEC)   566  centralised,  thus  the  proposed  work  is  translation  invariant.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS   In [7], skin color segmentation is used as the pre-processing  step  to  separate  the  hand  gesture  from  the  background.  In  normal  scenario,  when  a  ‘Bharatanatyam’  dancer  is  actually  performed,  tip  of  the  fingers  and  middle  of  the  palm  are  decorated  with  red  color.  As  proposed  in  [7],  if  skin  color  segmentation is used as the first pre-processing step to detect  hand  gesture  and  remove  unwanted  information  in  the  background.  Fig.  3(ii)  shows  the  skin  color  segmentation  of  ‘Ardhachandran’ hand gesture; it is shown that the portion of  the  hand  which  is  coated  with  red  color  is  not  taken  as  the  segmented output. Skin color segmentation is based on color,  i.e., value of the pixel. If the pixel value is  within a specific  range,  then  the  output  is  taken  as  the  skin,  otherwise  those  pixels are rejected as non-skin pixels. Fig. 3 (iii) depicts that  after application of edge detection technique (here Sobel edge  detection  is  performed);  proper  boundary  of  hand  is  not  obtained.  On  the  other  side,  if  texture  based  segmentation  is  used with threshold value 0.7 on the same RGB image shown   in Fig. 3 (i), exact boundary of the hand gesture is produced as  shown  in  Fig.  3  (vii).  Basic  principle  of  texture  based  segmentation is that it is based on entropy calculation. It is the  reason,  texture  based  segmentation  gives  better  result  as  compared  to  skin  color  based  segmentation.  The  above  mentioned process is elaborately explained in Fig. 3.     Fig. 3.  ‘Ardhachandran’ (i) Original RGB image, (ii) Skin color   segmented image, (iii) Image after filling of holes, (iv) Edge detected image,  (v) texture based segmented image, (vi) Holes are removed, (vii) Smoothed  boundary of hand gesture   is  recognized  by       Fig. 4 (i) shows the unknown hand primitive, where no red  color  decoration  is  done  on  the  hand.  Fig.  4  depicts  how  an  unknown  hand  gesture  the  proposed  algorithm.  Here  the  unknown  hand  gesture  should  be  recognized as ‘Hamsayam’ gesture. For this case also texture  based segmentation is producing proper boundary of the hand  gesture shown in Fig. 4 (ii). Edge of the hand gesture detected  using  Sobel  edge  detector  is  presented  by  Fig.  4  (iv).  The  straight line approximated image of the boundary is described  in Fig. 4 (v). The chain code for unknown hand gesture is 333  33351333335553322222.  As  already  stated,  zero  padding  is  applied  if  the  unknown  chain  code  is  less  than  31.  After  adding zeros to the right side of the code, the unknown chain  code  becomes  3333335133333555332222200000000.  The  actual  chain  code  for  ‘Hamsayam’  hand  primitive  from  the  dataset  with  zero  padding  is  33333131143335552222220000  00000. From the two chain codes, one for the unknown image,  and  the  other  for  ‘Hamsayam’  posture,  maximum  no  of  position  is  matched,  which  is  24.  Thus  the  unknown  hand  gesture  is  recognized  as  ‘Hamsayam’  gesture  and  it  proves  that correct recognition is possible by the proposed algorithm.      We have prepared a dataset of 140 images. Each of the  28  single  hand  gestures  is  taken  5  times.  The  proposed  algorithm gives accuracy rate of 89.3%, which is much greater  than  the  recognition  rate  of  [6],  which  is  81.4%.  Translation  invariance problem is tackled by this algorithm. The average  timing  complexity  of  the  algorithm  is  3.312  sec  in  an  Intel  Pentium Dual Core processor running Matlab R011b for each  RGB static image. Thus the proposed algorithm is very much  useful for e-learning purpose as it gives better accuracy with a    2014 International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Energy & Communication(CIEC)   567  less  amount  of  time.  The  dancer  needs  to  place  her  hand  in  front  of  the  camera,  so  that  the  camera  captures  the  hand  gesture  and  recognize  it.  To  tackle  the  false  recognition  rate  problem, we have introduced a threshold value (here it is taken  as 15). If any hand gesture matches less than 16 code positions  (taken experimentally) with the fundamental 28 hand gestures,  already stored in the dataset, then that hand gesture is declared  as ‘Non Bharatanatyam Hand gesture’.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK   The  entire  procedure  is  cost  effective  as  a  single  static  camera  is  needed  to  produce  the  necessary  input  images  for  the  proposed  algorithm.  Considering  the  complexity  of  the  dance  hand  gestures,  an  average  computation  time  of  3.312  sec in an Intel Pentium Dual Core processor running Matlab  R011b  is  highly  effective  for  each  RGB  input  image.  The  accuracy  rate  is  much  better  than  the  previous  work  [1],  we  are achieving more 7.9% accuracy than the previous one. The  accuracy of our proposed work is 89.3%, which is very much  appreciable for e-learning purpose.   However  certain  shortcomings  still  do  exist.  In   the  proposed algorithm, we have used simple background for hand  gesture  recognition  and  achieved  recognition  rate  of  89.3%.  However  in  the  case  of  complex  background  the  recognition  rate falls, as unwanted background pixels are also considered  as  hand.  This  algorithm  gives  good  results  in  simple  background, but for complex background the algorithm needs  to be improved. Another problem is that we are using cropped  images, but in the real time scenario, whole body of the dancer  is  taken  as  the  input  by  the  camera.  To  overcome  this  shortcoming,  we  are  using  particle  filtering  approach  for  detection  of  hand  region  in  a  video.  This  approach,  widely  employed in face detection, consists of scanning an image at  different positions and scales. Our final goal is to build a fully  automatic hand posture recognition system.   In a nutshell, hand gesture recognition of ‘Bharatanatyam’  dance  is  relatively  unexplored  and  the  proposed  work  is  an  attempt to address the problem with better accuracy and scopes  for further research.

Paul and Satwanti Kapoor   Introduction   Indian Classical Dance has a tradition that goes back at least fifteen  hundred years. The principles of modern dav anatomy and physiology have  therefore not been incorporated into the technical aspect of training in  Bharatanatyam. It is however true that most if not all principles of yoga were  taken into consideration while laying the foundations of dance. This is very unlike  the case in western dance forms which have a very strong base of anthropometry  and kinesiology in their training. As part of aesthetics, ballet involves studying  kinetics of body movement and understanding body language as a reflection of its  anatomy as well as physiology.   Indian Classical Dance under informed in terms of modern physiology  fares no better when it comes to occurrence of injuries as a result of practising thé  art form. Injuries to the body, especially the hip, knee, ankle, calf, shoulder and  back regions have been well studied and documented among the Western Classical  Dancers, Unfortunately, documentation about injuries sustained by Indian Dancers  is tar behind. There exists in India, practically no literature on the possible types  of injuries which could be caused by the physical rigours of dance. To even remotely  understand this effect òf injuries. it is very essential to undertake an in-depth study  of the various positions and movements adopted while dancing.

The only difference  - and that is a major one, is that this structure, rather than being based on functional  anatomy lays its foundation on the aesthetic beauty of lines and angles formed by  varied positioning of a/?^.v or differeht parts of the body. The term "different  parts of the body" is rather loosely formulated whereas the ancient Indian texts or  shastras distinguish among angas , upangas and pratyangas , making the distinction  much more discretions subiect to finer manipulations.   On the relation between dance and anatomy, Celia Sparger broke the   ground with her Anatomy and Ballet (1 949 ). After a gap of fifteen years Raoul  Gebabert published a series of well received articles finally brought out in a book,  Anatomy for the Qancer ( 1964). More than just the physicians from the medical  community, it were the movement scientist, dancers, artists, well informed teachers   and performers who showed keen interest in the scientific investigation of anatomy,  physiology and dance. It was their enthusiasm and intrigue that léd tó a host of  articles in the seventies. The chief workers in understanding the pathogenesis of  dance injury, who went on further to lay the foundation for future scientific and  clinical investigation into injury management and prevention were Hardaker,  Erickson and Meyers.   Today injury management and prevention in dance has come a long way   from a mere clinical investigative procedure to application of therapy, rehabilitation,  providing scientific accessories and even availability of designer knees for those  with varying degrees of knee disabilities! In coiirast, commendable scientific work  on any Indian Classical Dance form is yet to materialise. To our knowledge, this  study is the first of its kind to be undertaken on any Indian classical dance forms.  Ours is a modest attempt to investigate the occurrence of dance related injuries  among Bharatnatyam Dancers.   Materials and Methods   The dancers who participated in the present study were primarily taken  from two different dance schools in India, namely Kalakshetra and Bharatakalanjali,  Madras. While the former had a more rigorous and intensive training schedule,  the latter though disciplined adopted a more relaxed approach.   The dancers in Kalakshetra spend 4-5 hours per day, six days a week in  practice, and sometimes even more during festival seasons, running into almost  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:37 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    Indian Anthropologist (1998) 28 : 2 23   continuous hours and days of dancing. The also had an academic curriculum to  which they had to adhere. This involved practical and theory examinations in both  dance and music. The dancers of Bharatakalan jali on the other hand spent relatively  lesser hours per week in dancing. Being free of examinations, they were devoid of  tension which was quite evident in their physiological functions. Another factor  contributing to the physical, physiological and mental fitness of the dancers was  the fact that 95% of the Kalakshetra dancers were hostel residents whereas all the   Bharatakalan jali dancers were dav scholars.   A total to 40 dancers from Kalakshetra and 30 from Bharatakalanjali   were taken to participate in the study and each group was studied for occurrence of  dance injuries, in addition to other anthropometric and physiological investigations.  Apart from verbal communication and acknowledgement of existence of an injury,  the dancer was also requested to provide a doctors report on the duration, extent  and treatment of the injury.   Results and Discussion   Table : 1 shows the mean and standard deviation values of a few physical  (age; stature; weight; knee, ankle and bitrochanteric diameter) and physiological  (heart rate; systolic and diastolic blood pressure) parameters among dancers. The  mean age of the KD was 19.75 years while that of the BD was 17.08 years. The  two groups showed a difference of only 5.4 cm. in height. The average weight of  KD was 50.46 kg. as compared to 52.48 kg. of the BKD. Among the three diameters,  namely knee, ankle and bitrochanteric. the least difference (0. 1 1 cm) was found in  the ankle diameter. Both the groups had heart rates above 80 bpm, the KD having  an average heart rate of 8 1 . 1 8 bpm. and the BKD displaying a rate of 85.83 bpm.  The KD showed an average BP of 1 1 1 .25/82.20 mmHg while the BKD showed a  lower BP of 104.7/77.76 mmHg.   The largest difference in values between the groups was found in the   SBP, that of 6.5 mmHg. This was followed by stature which showed a difference  of 5.4 cm. Both Stature and SBP showed high S.D. values of 24.36 cm and 18.66  mmHg. The diameters were the most consistent exhibiting small differences ranging  from 0. 1 1 cm. to 0.53 cm.   The BKD showed a higher value for all the parameters under consideration  except BP. That is to say that though younger, they were taller, heavier, had larger  diameters and a higher H.R.

For age there was no  significant difference between ID and NID among both KD and BKD. For stature  although KD showed nonsignificant difference between ID and NID, BKD showed  a significant difference '(/ = 0.072, /? = (), 94$). '' Weight 'did not show any significant  difference between ID and NID. None of the three diameters among the two groups  of dancers showed any significant difference between the ID and the NID. Among  the KD, the ID had lesser H.R. and higher BP aš compared to the NID, while  among the BKD. the ID had a higher H.R. and lesser BP.   Tables 3 and 4 display the frequency of occurrence òf dance related i n juries   among Bharatanatayam dancers.   Of the 70 cases investigated, 25 of them suffered from some serious dance   related in jury or the other. Most of these were of the kind which required them to  take time off their dancing schedules and rest their bodies. A few cases of debilitating  in juries having had caused a dancer to completely give up the profession were also  reported but since these dancers were not available for comment at the respective  schools they have not been incorporated into the study.   Among the Kalakshetra Dancers (KD henceforth), 65% of the subjects   did not report any dance related in juries, i.e., 35.00% of them suffered Irom some  disability in their anatomy caused by dancing. One the same lines, 36.66% of the  Bharatakalanjali Dancers (BKD henceforth) were found to be afflicted.   Fifty-six percent of all injuries were associated solely with the knee or   the knee in conjunction with some other disability or pain. Of those injured, 75.96%  reported exclusive knee pain without any other affliction in any part of their anatomy  and 39.6% reported knee injuries complemented by injuries at other sites. KD had  a greater incidence of compound injuries involving the knee (21 .42%). as compared  to BKD, who showed an incidence of 18.18%, 50% of the KD suffered from more  than one in jury as compared to only 36% among BKD.   Knee injuries top the list of injuries in both the groups of dancers. KD   reported nd hip injuries whereas BKD reported no shoulder injuries. The frequency  of knee, loot and ankle in juries as available from western data is not very consistent.  Nevertheless, liiere isa su'Oftg pròci i vity towards greater knee complaints than to  those of foot and ¿inkle. All these injuries have been attributed to various dance  positions in Bharatanatyarn (Fig. I to Fig. 4),  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:37 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    hiiJum Anthmpologìst ( 1998)28:2 25   Knee Injuries   The greater frequency of knee complaints coutd be because of the   aramandi position in Bharatnatvam, (Fig 1). This is the basic posture in  Bharatanatyam and a majority of the culavus or steps arebased onthis fundamental  position. This position is rather similar to the demi-ptie in Ballet. Clippings  Robertson substantiates a high incidence of chondromalacia patellae among ballet  dancers and relates this specific knee problem to th cpUe in dance training. In a  study conducted by Çlippingeret al., ( 1984) on modern; aerobic and ballet dancers,  it was found that including both modern and ballet dancers, 38% of 362 dancers  reported having three or more classical symptoms of chondromalacia patellae.   In the present study, of the 14 complaints of knee pain, three (21.42%)   were in different stages of chondromalacia patellae, which is technically a softening  of the cartilage-the hyaline articular cartilage, stretched across the posterior surface  of the patella.   Four (28.57% ) were diagnosed as having torn their menisci in the constant  strife towards achieving the perfect armandi. In simple words, trying to piarti the  feet, with heets just a few centimetres apart, along a 1 80 degree line with the knees  Hexed. This inflicts unusually .severe stress on the medial structure of the knee-  particularly the medial retinaculum, the tibiaL collateral ligament and the medial  meniscus, causing excessive rotation of the tibia beneath the femoral condyles.  Forced external rotation can cause the miniscus to become trapped beneath the  femoral condyle and the tibial plateau and the meniscus may become torn in its  midsubstancc. This condition is diagnosed as tear of the medial meniscus and the  dancer complaints of pain during twisting, squatting and attempted rotation of the  knee accompanied by swelling and tenderness.   Five (35.7 1 % ) had various degrees of patellar injuries. Prevalent among  them were those of subluxation and dislocation evidently in those dancers with  increased femoral anteversion. Two other dancers with a history of knee pain  were yet to receive a verdict from their orthopaedicians.   Foot and Ankle injuries   Two cases of Impingement Syndromes (40%), one of Tendinitis (20% ),   one of sprain (20%) and one of Achilles tendinitis (20%) were observed among  the five who reported foot and ankle in juries. Dancers who have a limited external  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:37 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    26 DANCE RELATED INJURIES   rotation at the hip. resulting in a dissatisfactory natural turnout, are the ones  affected. To achieve the desired external rotation of the lower extremity, they  excessively rotate their knee or ankle joints externally (Gelabert, 1977; Howse.  1972: Miller. Schneider. Bronson and McLain, 1975; Quirk 1983; Tliormasen  1982). Another compensatory mechanism is the rolling in and sickling out to  achieve an increased turnout at the hip, causing tendinitis of the flexor hallucis  kmgus (Gelabert, 1977; Hovvse. 1972; Sammarcho, 1984).   The aramandi position (similar to the demi-plie of ballet but with the   heels placed closer) actually leads to the impingement of the anterior lip of the  tibia on the talcr neck. The kuttumm (Fig. 2) (similar to demi-ponte of ballet but  with the knees flexed) in Bharatanatyam leads to extreme plantar flexion causing  posterior impivigement. Four out of five reported mild to severe levels of pain of  the os caleis, caused by repealed striking of the foot flat on the ground while in  aramahdi position. This kind of movement involving the lifting of the foot  backwards and striking it hard on the floor happens to be one of the fundamentals  of nritta or pure dance. Since most of the dancihg in India is done on stone or  concrete floors it is not surprising that all the dancers at one time or the other face  unbearable pain of the calcaneous and tenderness of the tissues surrounding it.  According to Hamilton ( 1 982), a vast majority of foot qnd ankle injuries are chronic  and relate to a single primary mechanism-ťhe repetitive impact loading of .the lower  extremities on a hard unyielding surface.   Since dance today is an extended interpretation of what existed 2000   years ago. we cannot be convinced about its authenticity. Bharatnatyam has changed  over the centuries and at the hands of great exponents. Since the knowledge of the  human body was quite developed even in early India (The Charaka Samahita, a  major medical treatise which included surgery, dates to the first century AD and  wits followed by the Sushruta Samahita), it is possible that our interpretation of the  dance has side-tracked so much that it has started causing injury to the body.   Hip and Back Injuries   A total of 34.37% of the injuries were of the back and a lesser 7. 1 % were   of the hip. Most of the low back pains are primary in origin but less frequently, it  is secondary to compensations necessitated by primary involvement of the lower  extremities (Bachrach, 1 984). Low back injuries are rarely due to a single injury  and usually result from repealed superimposition of microtraumata. Spondylolysis  is a condition caused by such hyper extensions and hyperflexions which aggravate  when performed with maladaptive body alignment.

Compromise on technique, however is not an acceptable concept in the  Kalakshetra style. Majority of low hack in juries can therefore be said to be overuse   related and secondary to alignment technique defects. This Unding is substantiated  among ballet dancers by Bachrach (1984). Yet another important reason was the   lotal neglect T)> the dancer of a proper warm up before and at least a minimal cool  down after practice. Most dancers did not feel the need for a warm up in the  tropical humid environs, arguing that the ambient temperature was enough.  Needless to say, activity based on this decidedly wrong notion would increase the   chances of an injury. In both the dance schools (located in southern tropical regions)  a warm up is generally excluded under the impression that the high ambient  temperatures would have anyway warmed up the body.   In an attempt to increase turnout, the dancer hyperextends the hip by   contracting the iliopsoas muscle and thereby also increasing lordosis. A similar  compromise on the lower back and hyperlordosis also occurs when the dancer  hvperedtends her knees (Recurvatum ).   Shoulders and Others   This category includes not only those with injuries to the shoulder and   other regions not mentioned in the above three categories but all episodes of multiple  injuries.   The shoulder pains reported were mostly those caused by muscle pulls  owing to sudden jerky movements in the absence of a proper warm up session.  Other complaints included giddiness and headaches, especially after a long session  of dancing. This was compounded by the humid equatorial climate of Madras  where temperatures touched up to 43 degree Celsius. Since all the classes were  held outdoors under the shade of a banyan tree or in the shadow of a thatched roof,  the direct effect of the oppressive heat was quite evident. Central air-conditioning  was evidently unheard of and impractical in these traditional bamboo huts.   It was found that most of the dancers had strong quadriceps, hamstrings  and hip flexors. They had moderately developed calf muscles and almost everyone  had verv weak abdominals. Thoser who exhibited strong abdominals during the  curl up test were those who indulged in other sporting activities and exercised  specific muscle groups on a regular basis.

Following closely are lije fool and ankle complex, hip shoulders and others.  The reasons for these dance related injuries seem to be :   ( i ) The state of tension among the students in competition with their peers,  with pressure from teachers, expectation of parents, oncoming  examinations and the high standards of the institute itself.   ( ii) Lower levels of natural flexibility and fitness.   (iii) The hard concrete floor on which they dance.   (iv) Adoption of compensatory techniques in the absence of natural inherent   capacities.   Suggestions   (i) Incorporation of proper wann up and cool down routines before and   after class respectively. These should not be neglected despite the fact  that the dancers practised under conditions of extreme heat.   (ii) Incorporation of yog ic stretches and asanas into warm up routines would  improve lower levels of flexibility and fitness. This would ensure a  minimal acceptable level of flexibility conductive to effective dance  training.   (iii) Creating awareness among the teachers and students about the basic   structure and functions of the human body, thereby teaching them to  operate within the limits of the basic body structure of each individual,  without adhering rigidly to the standards set by the ancient texts.   (iv) Reverting to traditional floors made of mud and clay and smeared with  a thick antiseptic solution of fresh cowdung mixed with paddy husk or  any other floor made of good shock absorbing material.   (v) Attempts at halistic muscular development and flexibility with special   emphasis on those areas which are used minimally in dancing.

At Home in the World?  The Bharatanatyam Dancer As  Transnational Interpreter  Janet O’Shea  The stage lights come up gradually as a bharatanatyam dancer, costumed in a tailored silk sari and beautifully adorned in jewelry, walks out from backstage. In a manner neither formal nor completely relaxed, she walks downstage to a point beyond the normal performing space but still removed from the audience. She be- gins to explain the key features of this South Indian classical dance form. More speciﬁcally, she extracts, for decoding, the symbolic hand gestures known as mu- dras from bharatanatyam’s semiotic lexicon. Standing in one place and without musical accompaniment, she performs mudras ﬂuidly and gracefully. Meanwhile, she also translates into English the sahitya, or lyrics, of the song that the gestures will accompany. Demonstrating her skill in elegantly balancing the competing tasks of speaking and rendering gestural movement, she alerts the audience to the linguistic nature of the abhinaya, or dramatic dance.1  At the end of the synopsis, the dancer retreats backstage. A musical interlude signals the beginning of the “actual” performance. The dancer reappears, walking crisply. When she launches into the performance of the piece, her gestures ﬂow easily as in the explanation, but now she augments them with evocative facial ex- pressions and a directed use of her gaze.  Bharatanatyam, a highly technical, primarily solo South Indian classical dance form, consists of a repertoire and vocabulary that bifurcates into nritta, abstract rhythmic choreography, and nritya or abhinaya, dramatic dance. Its nonthematic sections consist of explosions of virtuoso footwork, performed with legs rotated outward into a bent-knee position that exempliﬁes the form’s characteristically grounded use of weight. An erect torso ﬂoats gracefully above the dynamic feet. The abhinaya component, by contrast, organizes itself around lyrical, leisurely phrases of gestural movement traced by articulated ﬁngers, hands, and arms. In these segments, the dancer walks in time to the music, her body position almost quotidian in comparison with the sharply delineated positions of the more stac- cato phrases.  Preperformance explanations have characterized bharatanatyam performances over the course of the 20th century. In the mid-1920s, when brahman lawyer E.  The Drama Review 47, 1 (T177), Spring 2003. Copyright 䉷 2003 New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  176   Bharatanatyam 177  Krishna Iyer initiated his mission to resurrect bharatanatyam as a cultural treasure, he did so through lecture demonstrations as well as performances, which he offered in cities and towns of Southern India (Arudra 1986/87b:33). Jewish- American dancer Ragini Devi’s ﬁrst international tours of classical Indian dance forms in 1937 and 1938 consisted of lecture demonstrations as well as concerts (The Civil and Military Gazette 1938).2 In the mid-1940s, Ram Gopal introduced to his tightly designed series of short, classical Indian dances brief verbal explana- tions, which preceded each dance with a sketch of its overall theme (David 2001:35–36). The speciﬁc practice of executing mudras while offering a verbal interpretation of sung poetic texts rose in popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s. During the early 1990s, the practice became so prevalent that dancers imported explanation into Indian performance contexts, including into bharatanatyam’s home city of Chennai, formerly Madras.3  The demand for translation signals bharatanatyam’s 20th-century history of recontextualization and its long-standing international circulation. The practice of interlocution both responds to and obscures the dance form’s participation in a global culture market. It reveals the kind of historical double binds4 with which the late-20th-century bharatanatyam dancer contended. The practice of verbal explanation thus speaks to the 20th-century predicament of bharatanatyam in which the dance form appears internationally as both an emblem of national and diasporic identity and as a “high art” that transcends national and linguistic boundaries.  At the same time, however, verbal translation paradoxically accords the chore- ography an inscrutability while also demonstrating its translatability. This kind of preperformance synopsis lines up two thought systems: an English verbal frame- work and a South Indian choreographic one. The explanation of mudras in succession interprets the “Eastern” choreography through the “Western” linguis- tic system. The English-language epistemology thereby emerges as the means through which the audience ﬁnds the choreography intelligible. Thus, this style of translation relies upon a problematic5 that treats the English-language frame- work as a mere explanatory device without its own cultural coding. A spoken in- terlocution thus risks representing bharatanatyam more as a means of entry into a cultural ﬁeld of reference,6 than as a set of choreographic choices and composi- tional devices.7  Orientalism and Globality  When a dancer, viewer, or promoter presents bharatanatyam as both requiring and evading translation and treats the English-language explanation as culturally “neutral,” s/he revisits the central premise of the 18th- and 19th-century orien- talist treatment of Indian literary and scholarly texts.8 The orientalist model of translation rested on the assumption that the “Eastern” text required the interven- tion of an interlocutor who, through his9 specialist knowledge, could unlock its mysteries for “the West.” The public who received this information, within the ori- entalist paradigm, inhabited the position of subject rather than object of knowl- edge. The representation of “foreign” texts and practices within 19th-century European society thus did not encourage viewers/readers to examine their own cultural investments but rather reinforced the presumed objectivity of their own social and political position.10  Preperformance translations, like the textual material of the colonial orientalist period, characterize bharatanatyam as an object of knowledge, to be uncovered and explained by an expert interlocutor. Nonetheless, they invert an orientalist division of labor by conﬂating the roles of “native informant” and translator- author. As such, the translating dancer generalizes her own subject position by   178  Janet O’Shea  1. Subathra Subramaniam (left) and Mayuri Boonham from the British dance com- pany Angika (2001). (Photo by London Dong)  interlocuting for the dance form. The act of translation, then, marginalizes the dance form for its international viewership, designating it as that which requires expli- cation; but at the same time, this translation universal- izes the dancer’s status as she adopts the position of the agent of information.  The very appearance of verbal translation, however, complicates even this dichotomy between subjects and objects of knowledge. While a preperformance synop- sis foregrounds the dance’s “foreign-ness,” its stan- dardized mode of delivery reveals the dance form’s history of international circulation. Bharatanatyam, as well as sadir before it,11 circulated internationally and responded to global discourses on dance. This trans- national circulation dates back to, and, in some in- stances, anticipated the bharatanatyam “revival” of the 1930s and 1940s.12  The international performance careers of both In- dian and non-Indian dancers inﬂected the reﬁguration of the previously marginal sadir as the respectable con- cert form bharatanatyam.13 Modern dance forerunner Ruth St. Denis (Coorlawala 1992; Allen 1997),14 balle- rina and choreographer Anna Pavlova,15 and Indian modernist Uday Shankar (Erdman 1987)16 all played a role in the bharatanatyam revival, encouraging the return of audience members’ and dancers’ attention to Indian classical arts. Con- versely, Balasaraswati’s emphasis on expressivity won admirers among pre- and early modern dancers such as Ted Shawn and Martha Graham (Cowdery 1995:51; La Meri 1985:12; Pattabhi Raman and Ramachandran 1984:26) who found in her claim that interior experience articulated universal themes (Balasaraswati 1988) a corroboration of their own views on artistry. The early 20th-century reﬁguration of bharatanatyam as a stage practice likewise intersected with a global, modernist concern with the reinvention of dance as a serious “high” art. Revival period practitioners like Rukmini Devi and Balasaraswati both invoked discourses of in- dividual creativity in their representation and legitimation of bharatanatyam.17  In the 1980s and 1990s, bharatanatyam circulated through ever-more global tra- jectories. The dance form operates as, in Arjun Appadurai’s (1996) terms, inten- tional cultural reproduction for nonresident Indians in places as divergent as Los Angeles, Singapore, and Manchester. Bharatanatyam likewise provides a means of maintaining nationalist sentiment in exile for Sri Lankan Tamils in Canada, Ger- many, and the U.K.18 Practitioners of this dance form have brought it to such dis- parate locales as Japan and Argentina. Iconic representations of bharatanatyam appear in advertisements and travel guides; bharatanatyam dancers formed the back-up routine for Madonna’s performance for the 1999 MTV music video awards. The practice of this dance form likewise offers the successful performer international travel opportunities19 and acclaim, and requires a global orientation to achieve this level of success. Dancers who strive to maintain professional lives in Chennai perform internationally in order to attain a level of ﬁnancial reim- bursement that offsets the generally low honoraria offered by Chennai venues and to generate the credibility needed to maintain the interest of Chennai promot- ers.20 This state of transnational circulation, like the bharatanatyam revival’s rela- tionship to international discourses of dance, marks the concert art form as “always-already” global.21  Translation not only operated as a method for negotiating this international cir- culation of dancers and choreographies, but also provided dancers with a strategy   Bharatanatyam 179  for marketing their performance work in transnational dance milieus. By the late 20th century, bharatanatyam’s reputation as a reclaimed and respectable tradition produced a proliferation of trained and accomplished dancers. Chennai, for much of the last century, housed a surplus of bharatanatyam dancers in relation to its viewing public (Coorlawala 1996:71; Gaston 1996:119–21; Meduri 1996:xl)22 as did other Indian and international metropolises. In order to develop a career as a performer, a dancer, facing such a surfeit, can contend with her competition by cultivating new audiences. This task presents obstacles as the complex coding of bharatanatyam requires specialized skills on the part of audience members for full comprehension. When a dancer translates a piece before performing it, she bridges a perceived gap between content and perception, thereby enabling a broader range of spectators to access the piece.23  Although verbal interlocution reiterates an orientalist problematic, the factors that foster the appearance of interlocution unsettle orientalist notions of a static tradition. The 20th-century’s translating bharatanatyam dancer, rather than rep- resenting an ancient, unchanged culture, grappled with numerous, contemporary paradoxes. While some practitioners of the 1980s and early 1990s used verbal in- terlocution to contend with competing pressures upon the dance form, cho- reographers of the mid- to late 1990s, especially those working internationally,24 developed projects that “translate” (Erdman 1987) epistemologies, choreographic devices, and poetic texts, foregrounding rather than masking their transnational position.25 These projects align different linguistic, movement, and musical vocab- ularies in such a way that they subvert a tendency to place European thought sys- tems as the primary framework of interpretation.  Tactics of Globality: Alternatives to Orientalism  Toronto-based choreographer Hari Krishnan’s composition When God Is a Customer (1999)26 relies upon verbal translation but uses Telegu songs and their English translation, each as an accompaniment to different kinds of choreography. The piece counterposes sections that feature short, Telegu-language songs, which Krishnan27 interprets through bharatanatyam’s stylized gestures, with phrases of either quotidian gesture or abstract expressionist, contemporary dance–derived movement. The latter is accompanied by a spoken English translation of the po- etic text projected over the sound system. This strategy retains bharatanatyam’s characteristic relationship of dance to text. The piece de-exoticizes the mudra sys- tem for its Canadian audience, however, by treating it as equivalent to expression- ist and pedestrian movement vocabularies.  As the poems begin, the lights come up slightly and Krishnan materializes out of the shadows. Barely visible in silhouette, he suggests, through stylized gestures, an intimate encounter between a courtesan and her god-lover. In silence, seated on a pedestal, Krishnan mimes the heroine’s awakening the following day, stretch- ing his arms, throwing back his head, and using small delicate movements to sug- gest the lady’s ablutions. He holds a digniﬁed, feminine pose, with a straight arm propped on a raised knee, accompanied by the voice-over of an English phrase that expresses the courtesan’s joy: “Today is a good day.”  Krishnan stands, descends from the pedestal, and, in conjunction with the sung Telegu lyrics, uses mudras and facial expressions to convey the mood of the song. He traverses the stage in a stately manner, walking in time to the music. In the role of the heroine, Krishnan extends his hands and draws them back, indicating the request “ask him to come.” Subsequently, he raises a hand to his forehead and ex- tends it forward, bowing slightly, conveying the promise “I will give him a royal welcome.” He develops this mood of joyous anticipation, tracing his articulate hands and arms through improvised elaborations that invoke the regal status of the   180  Janet O’Shea  absent lover. At the end of the Telegu song, Krishnan resumes a more quotidian pose as he represents the woman patiently awaiting the paramour’s arrival.  The piece proceeds in this manner as stylized mudras sculpt the particular im- ages referred to in the Telegu refrains, the tone of which Krishnan conveys through semirealistic facial expression. During the English translation, however, his countenance remains neutral and he either holds a suggestive pose or extracts one word from the line of poetry, the connotations of which he invokes through the expansion of a symbolic gesture. For other phrases of English text, he suggests emotional overtones through full-body positioning rather than through facial ex- pression and gestures with a speciﬁc linguistic meaning. For example, in one sec- tion, as the poetry describes the heroine’s anxiety, he contracts his torso, bringing his hands to the center of his chest. He follows this sinking of the chest with a counteracting arch of the spine, led by the hands. He reaches his arms out from his center, pulling his entire torso into an open ﬂexion and creates a vulnerable look that supplements the straining arms.  In creating the piece, Krishnan aligned the Telegu songs so that they formed a linear narrative (1999). As a result, the non-Telegu speaking audience member can anticipate the development of the theme as it unfolds, aided not only by English translation but also by the momentum of the storyline as evoked by Krishnan’s gestures. Rather than dwell on a process of decoding, the non-Telegu speaking viewer’s attention can focus on the choreographic priorities of the bharatanatyam-derived movement as well as the more expressionist ones. Krish- nan’s alternation between stylized gesture for Telegu songs and a more abstracted vocabulary for their English translation therefore speaks directly to the problem- atic of interpretation for an international audience.28  In When God Is a Customer, Krishnan provides an alternate solution to a pre- performance explanation by situating verbal interpretation within the work itself. Instead of mystifying the bharatanatyam text by providing a synopsis of the pre- sumably cryptic mudras, Krishnan accompanies both English and Telegu sections with movement. He therefore equates the languages by treating both as dance ac- companiment rather than presenting one as the explanatory device for the other. By contrast, Triple Hymn (2000) by Angika, a British dance company consisting of dancer-choreographers Mayuri Boonham and Subathra Subramaniam, trans- lates not linguistic but melodic, choreographic, and rhythmic components into one another. The choreography interweaves bharatanatyam and carnatic music with European classical music. To the sounds of a European operatic melodic structure based on the words of the Sanskrit Gayatri Mantra and on a recitation of various names of Hindu goddesses, two dancers in classical costume render lyrical gestures from the bharatanatyam movement vocabulary. During the Gayatri Man- tra section, they perform symbolic mudras, suggesting worship, prayer, and other ritual actions. They subsequently depict the various forms of the goddess through characteristic iconographic poses.  Rather than treat bharatanatyam as a cultural icon that depends on a European vocabulary for clariﬁcation, Triple Hymn places two signiﬁers of classicism—bhar- atanatyam and European classical music—alongside each other. Boonham and Subramaniam intertwine two traditional interpreting one through the other. The choreographers thereby make explicit the cross-cultural exchange that fostered the project. The piece speaks to the dynamic, cosmopoli- tan London environment in which it was performed and, by pointing to such an ongoing interculturality, queries the need for explication.  forms instead of  Canadian choreographer Lata Pada’s Cosmos (1999), like Triple Hymn, ﬁnds similarities in two different epistemological systems. As its name implies, the work concerns itself with theories of universal creation. Cosmos opens on a semidark- ened, empty stage. A narrator, invisible but audible over the sound system, trans-   Bharatanatyam 181  2. (From left) Lakshmi Venkataraman, Prabha Raghavan, and Anandhi Narayanan in a program photo for the Cosmos pre- miere performance at Pre- mier Dance Theatre in Toronto, June 1999. (Photo by Cylla von Tiedemann)  lates into English a quote from the Creation Hymn, of the Rig Veda. The stanza reﬂects on the paradox of uni- versal creation: “In the beginning there was nothing and there was not nothing.” The unoccupied stage space reinforces the mysteriousness of the quote. An ensemble of dancers bursts forth from the wings, per- forating the charged vacuum with their interjections of dynamic, rhythmic phrases. The dancers careen through the space, pursuing one another into an in- creasingly tighter spiral.  They wind their way into a close circle. They pause for a moment, tense in their stillness, before launching a phrase of staccato footwork. Each dancer takes a wide stance with legs rotated out and knees bent, hands at her waist. Their alternating pattern of footwork impels their bodies across the stage as the center appears to eject them outward. Their trajectories, linear at ﬁrst, curve and cross, becoming increasingly chaotic. The ensemble, initially united, fractures into a collection of individual dancers, each tracing her own divergent spa- tial pathway after a “big bang” of explosive footwork.  In the next scene, the dancers condense their traveling movements into parallel paths that follow speciﬁc orbits. Their routes widen and ﬂatten elliptically so that they cross one another without pushing each other off course. While the ﬁrst scene traced a transition from disorder to equilibrium, this scene moves from or- der to disruption. The dancers’ set orbits waver as they deviate from their clear routes. The performers succumb to the pull of a black hole, resuming a pulsating phrase that indicates their increasing momentum as they catapult toward center stage.  The closing sections evince the harmony of the solar system. The dancers now develop cooperative relationships with one another, again interweaving without colliding or disrupting one another’s trajectories. They break off into duets. Back to back, the dancers exchange weight, arms and hands articulating themselves into classical bharatanatyam mudras as bodies remain taut and straight even in tilted po- sitions. The stylized gestures and the dancers’ verticality reinforce the image of stability and balance in the relationships between the relatively proximate heav- enly bodies.  Pada’s piece depicts the creation of the universe by tracking the transition from the churning of nebulous, protoplasmic energy, its explosion into deﬁned pieces of matter, and its ultimate condensation into the speciﬁc orbits of heavenly bodies. The choreography thereby blends the theories of creation put forth by European rationalist, scientiﬁc traditions, and by Vedic philosophy. As such, Cosmos explains the two epistemological systems through one another. The work, by placing the Vedic hymn at the beginning of a depiction of the “big bang,” highlights the con- tradiction at the center of both the Vedic and scientiﬁc explanations of creation in that each hypothesis suggests that matter arose from an undeﬁned primordial en- ergy. Although Pada uses an English translation of the hymn, she nonetheless fore- grounds the South Asian text as she uses it to demonstrate the paradox imbedded in the “big bang” theory rather than using the cosmological hypothesis to argue for the rationality of the philosophical tract. In contrast to an orientalist project of translation, therefore, her composition does not treat the European scientiﬁc model as an objective explanation but rather foregrounds how its contradictions echo the concerns of the Vedic philosophical tract. Thus, the South Asian knowl- edge system frames the scientiﬁc paradigm, a maneuver that reverses the premise of orientalist translation practices.   182  Janet O’Shea  3. Hari Krishnan at the Darasuran temple in Tanjavur, India. (Photo by Cylla von Tiedemann)  Each of these late-century projects offers bharatanat- yam an active role in a cosmopolitan urban environ- ment by deploying methods of exchange between epistemologies that circumvent or reverse an orientalist problematic. Krishnan retains the translation paradigm but de-exoticizes the relationship between text and ges- ture by using English and Telegu in an equivalent man- ner. Boonham and Subramaniam create a harmonious fusion of classical disciplines and symbols that highlights the hybrid positioning of performers and viewers alike and, therefore, questions the need for translation at all. Pada, like Krishnan, examines different thought systems through one another and inverts an orientalist frame by interpreting the European epistemology through the Vedic philosophical one rather than vice versa. Each of these projects treats bharatanatyam as an entity that re- sponds to the hybridity of its immediate, urban envi- ronment rather than as a discrete entity that requires explanation.  I began this essay with the image of the translating bharatanatyam dancer in order to query the historical legacy of this practice and, in doing so, to demonstrate what kinds of cultural and political dilemmas the late- 20th-century bharatanatyam practitioner faced. I sug- gested that verbal interlocutions retain orientalist frames but also that they emerge out of factors that belie orientalist narratives of unchanging tradition. The late- century experiments that I discuss here engage explicitly with bharatanatyam’s transnational position and offer the possibility that choreographic translations can move beyond orientalist models of interpretation. These choreographies, rather than representing isolated experiments, speak to the dance form’s history of stra- tegic negotiation with globality and hybridity as well as with the staging of local, regional, and national afﬁliations. In offering an alternative to orientalist para- digms, these projects present the possibility that practitioners can contend with the dance form’s complex historical legacy while also challenging viewer expec- tations. As such, they level the choreographic ﬁeld so that the dance form can truly be at home in the world.  Notes 1. This essay is based on presentations given at the Association for Asian Studies (2000) and  Dance Under Construction (2001) conferences.  2. Ragini Devi performed bharatanatyam and kathakali. She was among the ﬁrst foreigners to perform Indian classical dance forms, the ﬁrst nonhereditary dancers of both forms, and the ﬁrst female kathakali dancers.  3. The city of Madras was ofﬁcially renamed Chennai in the late 1990s, a shift that reinstated  the Tamil name of the metropolis.  I base this observation of the relative prevalence of preperformance translation on my experience viewing international bharatanatyam concerts from 1988 to the present and in comparisons between concerts in Chennai in 1989, 1995 to 1996, and 1999.  By using the phrase “home city,” I do not mean to suggest that the relationship between bharatanatyam and Madras/Chennai is organic and unself-conscious. Bharatanatyam estab- lished itself in Madras at the time of the bharatanatyam revival of the 1930s. This relationship did not go uncontested nor did it merely ﬁx bharatanatyam in this city. The relationship be- tween bharatanatyam, urbanization, and transnationalism requires more attention than I can give it here. For more information, see my discussion of bharatanatyam’s production of lo- cality (2001:155–213).   Bharatanatyam 183  4. I borrow this idea of the historical double binds of bharatanatyam from scholar and chore- ographer Avanthi Meduri who has designed a series of lectures in which she represents the tensions of gender, subjectivity, modernity, and nationhood through a performed limp.  5. I borrow this notion of a problematic of orientalism from Partha Chatterjee (1986). Chatter- jee argues that postcolonial nations inverted the problematic of colonialism—independence rather than continued subjugation—but relied upon the same thematic, that of a binary dif- ference between “East” and “West.” Here, I reverse Chatterjee’s argument in order to draw out a shared problematic between 18th- and 19th-century scholarly and 20th-century pre- performance translations.  6. British choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh comments on the assumption that contemporary dance derived from Indian movement vocabularies serves a function more “cultural” than artistic and links this premise to the practice of offering word-for-gesture translations (1995:192). Jeyasingh commences her Making of Maps (1991) with a deconstruction of the preperformance synopsis. Dancers’ voices, projected over the sound system, intersect and in- terrupt one another with phrases like “vanakkam; good evening” and “the tillana is a dance of joy.” Meanwhile, the ensemble moves slowly and decisively into and out of postures de- rived from bharatanatyam nritta choreography. Their impassive facial expressions contrast with the sunny voices of the verbal accompaniment.  7. Jeyasingh also identiﬁes an over-emphasis on literal meaning in the British reception of In-  dian performance forms ( Jeyasingh 1982:4).  8. Edward Said cites the scholarship of Sir William Jones in the late 18th century as the incep-  tion of orientalist scholarship in India (1979:75).  9. Here, I use the masculine pronoun intentionally in order to emphasize the gendered invest- ments of orientalist thought. See Koritz (1997) for more on the gendered underpinnings of Orientalism.  10. A classic example of this phenomenon is the 19th-century colonial exhibitions in Europe  (Mitchell 1992).  11. “Bayaderes” (temple dancers) from South India appeared in Europe for the ﬁrst time in 1838. 12. “Revival” is the most commonly used term for the reformulation of sadir as the concert art form bharatanatyam. As Matthew Allen suggests, however, this term is “drastically reductive” because this shift also consisted of a “re-population,” “re-construction,” “re-naming,” “re- situation,” and “re-storation” (1997:63).  13. The bharatanatyam revival—including its politics and its historical investments—has already received much scholarly attention and therefore I only gesture to it here. I refer to, for in- stance, Allen (1997), Coorlawala (1992, 1996), Gaston (1992, 1996), Meduri (1988, 1996), and Srinivasan (1983, 1985), as well as my own essay on the contrasting perspectives of Bal- asaraswati and Rukmini Devi (1998).  14. St. Denis performed her Nautch Dance and Radha before Indian audiences in 1926. Uttara Asha Coorlawala (1992) maintains that her performances encouraged Indian viewers to seek out the dance forms on which St. Denis based her choreography. Allen likewise notes this inﬂuence but also emphasizes that the direct impact of the Denishawn company on India was “short-lived” (1997:91).  15. Anna Pavlova, who brought ballet to the status of “autonomous art,” encouraged Rukmini Devi to seek out the art form of “[her] own country” (in Ramnarayan 1984a:29). Joan Erd- man discusses in some detail the inﬂuence that Pavlova had on Uday Shankar (1987:71–73) who, in turn, was a “catalyst to the renaissance in Indian classical dance” (69).  16. Shankar inﬂuenced the revival of classical Indian arts in several ways. First, as Erdman indi- cates, Shankar participated in the institutionalization processes that supported the classical Indian dance revivals by providing his students with training in bharatanatyam, kathakali, and manipuri alongside his own technique and improvisation classes (1987:84). He also helped to spark the career of legendary devadasi dancer T. Balasaraswati. At Balasaraswati’s ﬁrst concert at the Music Academy in 1933, Shankar, as a member of the audience, was so captivated by her dancing that he requested a repeat performance. Haren Ghosh, a friend of Shankar and an impresario, who also attended the performance arranged Balasaraswati’s ﬁrst concert out- side of southern India, which led to other concerts in north India and, ultimately, interna- tionally (Arudra 1986/87a:25, 1986/87c:20).  17. Both Balasaraswati and Rukmini Devi located in bharatanatyam opportunities for creativity and individual expression. While Rukmini Devi found creative expression in the composi- tion of new dances which, she maintained, sprang from traditional aesthetics (Ramnarayan   184  Janet O’Shea  1984b:32), Balasaraswati found opportunities for imaginative work in improvised sections of the inherited repertoire (Balasaraswati 1988:39).  18. I am indebted to Jeyanthy Siva for ﬁrst calling my attention to the use of bharatanatyam in  the production of Tamil nationalist sentiment.  19. For instance, Gaston states that younger generations of icai vellala (the caste group that largely constituted devadasi communities) dancers have pursued professional performance in recent years because of the possibility it provides for international travel (1996:129).  20. I base this observation on personal correspondence (1995–1996, 1999) with Chennai-based  dancers who are at different levels of renown and seniority.  21. I borrow the application of this Derridean phrase from Meduri (1996:400). Meduri uses this phrase to query the gendered implications of the air of respectability that bharatanatyam ac- quired in the mid- to late 20th century.  22. Senior dancer and teacher Kalanidhi Narayanan describes this surfeit through reference to “supply and demand” (1999). She suggests that Madras simply cannot provide solo concerts for all of its dancers as the number of dancers outweighs the number of performance slots. Gaston likewise identiﬁes a “dance boom” that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s (1996:119– 20).  23. Performers use other methods of bridging a gap in comprehension, including the provision  of libretti and, more rarely, the use of supratitles.  24. Translation experiments are not, however, exclusive to performances in non-Indian con- texts. Chennai-based choreographer Gitanjali Kolanad’s What She Said (1993), for example, deploys scholar A.K. Ramanujan’s English translations of Tamil Sangam poetry. Maharash- trian bharatanatyam dancer Sucheta Chapekar has reconstructed 17th- and 18th-century Marathi-language dance compositions and has integrated Hindustani (North Indian classical) music with bharatanatyam (Sethuraman 1985:46).  25. Experiments with cross-cultural interpretation are not unique to the late 20th century. For instance, as Joan Erdman (1987) argues, modernist Uday Shankar’s work translated Indian aesthetic components into European compositional frameworks.  26. Named after a scholarly text of the same title (Ramanujan, Narayana Rao, and Shulman,  1994).  27. Here, in the interest of consistency and in capitulation to European and American conven- tions of nomenclature, I identify dancers and choreographers by their second names. This creates an awkward ﬁt with Indian, and especially South Indian, naming conventions. How- ever, I do this to avoid a situation in which scholars appear by last name and dancers by ﬁrst name, an approach which might suggest that choreography is a less serious enterprise than writing.  28. The piece would have a different, although not necessarily predictable, effect in Chennai. The majority of dance viewers in Chennai speak Tamil with a signiﬁcant minority speaking Telegu as their ﬁrst language. Dance compositions until recently used a number of different languages, primarily Tamil, Telegu, and Sanskrit. In Chennai, as elsewhere, an emphasis on the comprehensibility of poetic texts has increased. Dancers, choreographers, and promoters have responded to this concern by presenting more pieces in the Tamil language (Nandini Ramani 1999).

This  understanding of the art as a transnational genre of a geolocal area contrasts with the  Indian perspective of the form as an Indian national art of the nation state. This paper  traces the development of the term ''South Asian" in U.S. academic practice in the post  World War II era and notes the adoption of the term in the British academy and by dance  practitioners in the United Kingdom. The South Asian label was transformative in that  it transnationalized and hybridized the historical identity of Indian bharatanatyam  in the 1980s. This transformation was realized not just through the juxtapositing of  local/global terms but through the establishment of local/global institutions. The history  and implications of the borrowing are detailed.   Avanthi Meduri is a reader in the dance programs and convener of the new interdis  ciplinary MA/PGDIP in South Asian dance studies at the University of Roehampton,  London. She received her PhD from the Department of Performance Studies, Tisch School  of the Arts, New York University, in 1996; has published widely; and is the editor of  Rukmini Devi Arundale (1904-1986) : A Visionary Architect of Indian Culture  and the Performing Arts (2005). Trained in bharatanatyam and kuchipudi since  childhood, her recent dance-theatre choreography featured a feminist theatre performance  of Rukmini Devi's biography, with the double title Birds of the Banyan Tree, and  What is in a Name? Productions were staged in India, the United States, and the  United Kingdom in 2004-2005.   Classical dance forms, including bharatanatyam and kathak,   were displayed as Indian national forms in the international cultural  exchange programs that India negotiated with the West in the 1960s.  Almost twenty years later, these same dance forms were re-presented as  emblematic Indian classical forms and traditions in the large-scale Fes   Asian Theatre Journal, vol. 25, no. 2 (Fall 2008). ? 2008 by University of Hawai'i Press.

T. Balasaraswati (1918  1984), who belonged to the hereditary traditions of temple and court  dancing, and Rukmini Devi Arundale (1904-1986), the celebrated  nonhereditary revivalist of twentieth-century bharatanatyam, were alle  gorized as the foremost dancers, feted with numerous national awards,  and presented as hereditary and nonhereditary traditional dancers  on the international stage of the 1960s (Meduri 2004: 11-29; O'Shea  2007). Malavika Sarukkai and Alarmel Valli, two eminent dancer-cho  reographers, emerging from the post-1960s generation, replaced their  predecessors and were profiled as international artists in the Festival of  India celebrations.   While the younger dancers innovated within the parameters of  the received classical tradition as elaborated by both T. Balasaraswati  and Rukmini Devi Arundale, they were different from their elders in  terms of the youthful energy and cosmopolitan ?lan with which they  performed on the world stage. Taking the international dance world  by storm, these two dancers inspired a new generation of bharatanatyam  dancers and constituted new local/global networks of communication  and exchange between India and the West in the 1980s.   Staged in various prestigious art venues in France, Italy, Lon  don, New York, Washington, and Los Angeles, the India Festivals were  momentous in that they built on already existing international net  works of communication, forged not just between India and the West  but also between India and its diaspora living in Britain and the United  States since the 1960s (Singh 1998: 52-58). Anthony Giddens explains,  "Globalization can be defined as the intensification of worldwide social  relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happen  ings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice-versa"  (Giddens 1990: 64).   What is interesting, however, is that it was in the late twentieth   century moment of emergent globalization when India emerged as a  Third World power that Indian dance forms, including bharatanatyam,  kathak, odissi, and kathakali, were casually sundered from the protec  tionist custody of the Indian nation-state and hastily renamed as South  Asian dance genres in the United Kingdom. Arts officers working in  the employ of the British Arts Council, well-meaning academics, venue  managers, and funding agencies were all implicated in the momentous  rechristening of Indian forms as South Asian forms. "South Asia," as  is well known, does not refer to a single country or nation-state but  is used as a generic descriptor to name and identify a block of Asian  nations including the nation-states of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal,  Bangladesh, Maldives, and so on.

Although the South Asian label manifested itself as a nascent,  emerging funding category in the 1980s, it was rapidly normalized and  transformed into a dominant institutional label in the 1990s, specifi  cally when major dance organizations, including Akademi,1 Kadam,2  and Sampad,3 funded by the Arts Council of Britain began to use this  institutional label to promote bharatanatyam in the United Kingdom. In  1998, the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dance (ISTD), in collabora  tion with Akademi: South Asian Dance UK, a cutting-edge, progressive  arts organization about which I shall say more later, devised a new syl  labus for bharatanatyam and kathak. Both genres were institutionalized  not as Indian but as South Asian dance forms.4   The South Asian label was similarly institutionalized in British   academia when the Leverhulme Trust awarded a substantial grant to  dance scholar Andr?e Grau to undertake research on a project called  South Asian Dance in Britain (SADiB) in 1999 (Grau 2002). In 2002, the  Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB) was awarded ?865,000  over a five-year period to fund research in cross-cultural Asian music  and dance. This was a joint venture shared between School of Oriental  Studies (SOAS), Roehampton University, and the University of Surrey  (Lopez y Royo 2002). As part of the Leverhulme award, Roehampton  dance faculty launched a new master of arts degree in South Asian  dance studies, and I was appointed as convener of the new program  in 2004, about which I will say more later. The South Asian label has  achieved wide currency in the United Kingdom today. It manifests itself  as a hegemonic category and is used to refer to the dances, literatures,  theatres, folk forms, cultures, cuisines, film, and music of the people  of South Asia.   The public culture and academic institutionalization of bharata  natyam under the new label of South Asian dance was beneficial from a  British South Asian diasporic perspective because it enlarged the Indian  label and made visible the diverse dance, performance, and theatre  practices of the Indian/Asian diaspora living in Britain since the 1960s.  Yet the spatialization can be seen to be problematic, albeit from a local  Indian standpoint, as it dislodged bharatanatyam from its sociohistori  cal moorings in Indian culture, history, and politics and relocated the  form within a broader, homogenizing category known as South Asia.   Two national labels, one Indian and the other British (South  Asian), were affixed to bharatanatyam in quite the same manner as pass  ports are stamped with national stamps or as brand names are pinned  to items of clothing dispatched to the far corners of the globe. The  relabeling was consequential because bharatanatyam acquired a double  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    The Transfiguration of Indian/Asian Dance 301   Figure 1: Mira Kaushik receiving her Order of the British Empire from Secre  tary of State for Culture, Tessa Jowell. (Photo: Geoff Wilson)   global/local identity after the renaming. One historical representation,  displayed within two national labels: this I believe is the historical the  matic that structures the production and circulation of bharatanatyam  in the United Kingdom today.   The ambiguity in the double Indian/South Asian label was  brought to the fore on the historic occasion when Mira Kaushik,  the director of Akademi,5 received an honorary Order of the British  Empire (OBE) from culture secretary Tessa Jowell for her contribution  to dance in the United Kingdom (Figure 1). At the award ceremony,  held on 8 March 2007, Jowell praised Kaushik's work in this way: "Mira  Kaushik has done a huge amount to bring Indian dance to the United  Kingdom's attention. Her vision for Akademi has delighted sell-out  audiences with fantastic shows and her coaching programmes are edu  cating a whole new generation of performers" (italics mine; Akademi  2007). It is important to note the slippage in descriptive terms: Jowell  refers to South Asian dance as Indian dance!   In her acceptance speech, Kaushik said, "I am delighted to  receive this award. It's due to the passion and hard work of thousands  of audiences, hundreds of South Asian dancers, dozens of Akademi's  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    302   Meduri   team members and a handful of patrons. I am very, very excited to be  doing what I am doing" (italics mine; Akademi 2007). Without refuting  Jowell's representation, Kaushik carefully repositioned her work within  the larger South Asian dance category!   By reinscribing Indian dance within the South Asian label,  Kaushik did something quite provocative. She claimed that although  Indian dance might look Indian, it is South Asian dance in the United  Kingdom because it is performed not just by immigrant dancers from  India but by "hundreds of South Asian dancers" belonging to the dif  ferent nations of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, and  Africa. Her explanation is challenging because it urges scholars and  spectators alike to think outside the box and identify the "same, but  not quite" differences between Indian and South Asian dance. Kaushik  does more in that she urges us to undertake this critical examination  from within the institutional history of the South Asian label as it was  enunciated in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.   History in the South Asian Label  If the terms "Indian" and "South Asian," appended to bharata  natyam, were random categories, there would be little need to dwell on  the significance of the two identity markers. What needs to be noted,  however, is that both were historical labels inscribed in imperial his  tory dating back to British colonialism in the nineteenth century. They  reemerged as doubled or yoked historical categories in the charged  historical context of British decolonization and Cold War politics of  the 1940s. Not only was Pakistan split from India in 1947, but it was  also here in this moment of the transfer of British colonial power to  independent India that the United States emerged as new hegemonic  power, and stepped into the historical space vacated by Great Brit  ain. Assuming the "white man's burden," the US State Department  remapped the Asian/Oriental world, split South Asia from its other  Asian neighbours, and designated post-partition India and its neigh  boring countries as "South Asia."   Sunil Khilani, author of the celebrated book The Idea of India  (Khilani 1998), avers that the "South Asia" born out of modern geo  politics, specifically the strange cartography of the US State Depart  ment in the early years of the Cold War, is a flat term?a bureaucrat's  phrase lacking the poetry of, say, "Europe," or, indeed, "India." He  explains that India and Europe are both names that contain poetry,  that embody stories, and that trail behind them often self-contradictory  myths of origin (Khilani 2004). "South Asia," by contrast, is a spatial  term of supreme artificiality and refers to an Asian bloc of the world,  struggling to embrace the ideals of Western modernity and democracy.

That experiment has been based on the rec  ognition, and the necessary acknowledgment, of the immense diversity  and variety posed by the 'diverse peoples' of the region, and the differ  ing extents to which this has been given expression" (Khilani 2004).   Academics and intellectuals in the United States endeavored to  capture the rich variety and diversity in the South Asian region in what  came to be designated as area studies programs of research, the most  famous being the Center for South Asian Studies, established at the  University of Chicago in the 1950s.6 Milton Singer, the distinguished  anthropologist, pioneered studies of Indian cultural performances  including dance and music in his groundbreaking book entitled When  a Great Tradition Modernizes (Singer 1972). Unlike in the United King  dom, the South Asian label remained an elitist, academic category  because Indian dance and music forms were neither homogenized nor  institutionalized as such in the United States.   When we track the genealogy of the South Asian label in the  British context, we find that South Asia is an alien term because it did  not have any currency during British rule in India. Derived from the  United States, the South Asia label was adapted and institutionalized  in British academia, specifically, the Centre for South Asia Studies,  founded within SOAS, in 1966.7 Why did Britain accept US social sci  ence labeling and funding categories in the 1960s? Did South Asia rep  resent a catch-all phrase to forget the trauma of partition created by  Britain? Or did the migration of people from different nations, includ  ing Bangladesh, Pakistan, West Africa, and Sri Lanka, to the United  Kingdom in the late 1960s necessitate the enlargement of the "Indian"  category?   Edward Said does not address any of these questions revolving  around postcolonial nation formations and migration in his magiste  rial account, Orientalism (1978). He argues instead that Anglo-Ameri  can area studies programs were implicated in Orientalist construction  of India and Asia. Both narratives deployed the trope of the Asian/  Indian/Pakistani to construct and essentialize East/West epistemologi  cal differences though the long period of British rule in India, and  continuing into Cold War politics of the 1950s.   Since the South Asian label was inscribed in Western imperial  history, we can adopt a local Indian perspective and question British/  American Orientalism, specifically the casual ease with which Brit  ish/American institutions of patronage disembedded Indian dance  forms and relocated them within a spatial category known as South  Asia. Or, we could take a post-Orientalist diasporic perspective and cel  ebrate British Orientalism in the manner proposed by British dance  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    304   Meduri   scholar Andr?e Grau. In her essay titled "A Sheltering Sky? Negotiat  ing Identity through South Asian Dance," Grau suggests provocatively  "that within a diasporic context, one could argue that the South Asian  label was more neutral than the Indian one as the former removes the  dance from any notion of a clear-cut lineage and a nostalgic notion of  lost heritage" (Grau 2004). She explains that decontextualizing dance  forms in this way might be useful as it could conceivably encourage a  discourse about dance forms such as bharatanatyam as less rooted in cul  ture and ethnicity and more in technique, thus rendering the form(s)  transnational (Grau 2004).   Transformation of Indian/Asian Dance  in the United Kingdom  I want to move beyond the local/global critiques of Orientalism  and suggest that the juxtapositiong of local Indian and global South  Asian labels was transformative in that the South Asian term transnation  alized and hybridized the historical identity of Indian bharatanatyam in  the 1980s. This transformation was realized not just through the juxta  positing of local/global terms but through the establishment of local/  global institutions such as Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, which opened its  UK wing in 1972.8 As one institution was insufficient to accomplish the  huge task of internationalizing Indian dance in the United Kingdom,  Tara Rajkumar, a well-known dancer and choreographer, arrived from  India in the late 1970s and founded a second local/global institution  known as the National Academy for Indian Dance (NAID) in 1979.  Although NAID changed its name to Akademi: South Asian Dance in  the UK in the late 1990s, about which I will say more presently, it was  this second international institution, itself inscribed in a double name  and history, that hybridized and transnationalized the historical iden  tity of Indian bharatanatyam in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. While  Bhavan's goal was to "preserve for posterity the tradition of Indian art  and culture" in the United Kingdom (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, UK  Centre n.d.), NAID/Akademi desired to enlarge received aesthetic  definitions of the "traditional" and "classical" through strategic acts of  cultural translation and situate Indian dance on the multicultural map  of Great Britain.   Roland Robertson suggests that intercultural institutions such   as Bhavan and NAID/Akademi, formed by "telescoping global and  local to make a blend," best be described from within a new discursive  category known as "glocalization" (Robertson 1995: 28). He argues that  this term is useful to document empirical processes of globalization  without resorting to easy polarizations that pitch the local against the  global and vice-versa (29).

She began her work in the United  Kingdom by collaborating with Bhavan, then founded her own second  institution, known as NAID, where she developed her own individual  ized, multicultural vision to integrate Indian dance into mainstream  British culture. Pushkala Gopal, another famous dancer from India,  was inspired by Rajkumar yet pursued a different artistic trajectory. She  too collaborated with Bhavan and with NAID, but also with her dancer  teachers, the renowned Dhananjayans living in India, and positioned  the production of Indian dance within local/global networks. In the  early 1980s, Gopal performed bharatanatyam duets with male dancer  P. Unnikrishnan, himself a renowned student of the Dhananjayans, and  professionalized the presentational format of her recitals. She assumed  the directorship of NAID in the late 1980s and founded her own dance  company along with Unnikrishnan.   Sundaram, another established dancer from India, arrived in   London in 1981 via the Middle East and Europe. She too taught dance  in the Bhavan, worked collaboratively with NAID, and performed  "chic" bharatanatyam recitals with provocative English titles, such as Of  Gods and Kings and Ordinary Men, at various mainstream venues, includ  ing London's Saddlers Wells theatre. Sundaram's professional dance  career in the United Kingdom was brief; she left for the United States  and returned only to take charge of the editorship of the UK-based  dance magazine known as Pulse: South Asian Dance in the UK, now part  of the legacy of South Asian Dance in Britain.   The renowned Jeyasingh, trained in Indian bharatanatyam, also  enabled the goals of Bhavan and NAID in the early 1980s but founded  the Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company in the late 1980s. She re  emerged dramatically as a contemporary South Asian dancer-choreog  rapher and took British contemporary dance world by storm (Figure  2). Jeyasingh articulated a new, aesthetic vision for "contemporary"  South Asian dance in Britain by deconstructing bharatanatyam dance  vocabulary and urbanized the classical form by combining it with West  ern postmodern movement genres. We see this theme of hybridization  and urbanization inscribed in her landmark choreographies Duets with  Automobiles (1993) and Making of Maps (1992-1993), discussed provoca  tively by Valerie Briginshaw (2001: 97-109).   All four intercultural dancers mentioned above, belonging to   different linguistic backgrounds, had one thing in common. They all  recognized the importance of institutionalization and thus collabo  rated with British and Indian/British institutions. All four dancers were  bilingual, postcolonial subjects, fluent in English, having studied Shake  speare and Shelly in their countries of national origin, whether it be  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    Figure 2.

They thus translated Indian dance forms inscribed  in multilingual vernacular histories into new English-language intel  lectual frameworks proposed by the former empire, hybridized the  production of Indian dance, and constituted new, multilingual visions  for Indian/South Asian dance in the United Kingdom. Homi Bhabha  (1994) celebrates diasporic hybrids as intercultural brokers working  in the interstices of nation and empire, producing counternarratives  from the nation's margins to the totalizing boundaries of the nation.  Hybridization is defined as the ways in which "forms become separated  from existing practices and recombine with new forms in new prac  tices" (Rowe and Schelling 1991: 231).   Instead of tracking the intercultural artistic careers of the four  pioneer dancers, I shall describe how NAID/Akademi enlarged the  Indian prefix and institutionalized Indian bharatanatyam creatively in  what I encapsulate as the emergent, consolidation, and arrival stages  of its development between 1979 and 2007. My main interest here is  not to detail the pioneering work of NAID/Akademi. I wish merely to  describe how NAID emerged as an intercultural institution in the 1970s;  transformed itself into Akademi9, a postcolonial institution in the late  1990s; and rearticulated itself as a transnational diasporic institution  at the turn of the twenty-first century. In this time span, encompass  ing twenty-eight years, NAID/Akademi articulated a British identity for  Indian/South Asian dance in the United Kingdom.   Parti  NAID's Emergence as Intercultural Institution  in the United Kingdom (1979-1988)  I began my research on Indian/South Asian dance in the United   Kingdom by interviewing Mira Kaushik, the director of Akademi.10  She was most generous and talked freely about dance and work in the  United Kingdom, so I asked Kaushik if she could divulge the name of  the person who renamed Indian dance as South Asian dance in the  United Kingdom. Amused by my curiosity and perplexed that I was  asking this question after so much work had been achieved under the  South Asian label, Kaushik advised me to speak with the indomitable  Simon Dove, a great friend of India who worked as dance officer for  the British Arts Council in the 1980s.11 Thus I sought out Dove; met  him in Bergen, Norway, in 2004; and questioned him eagerly about the  new South Asian label.   But Dove shook his head and explained patiently that although   he had used the South Asian term in his Vivarta: Contemporary South  Asian Performance Festival, the label was not new and was, in fact, circu  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    308   Meduri   lating in the British social imaginary and also in the corridors of the  Arts Council in the 1980s. He spoke about the pioneering work of Nas  eem Khan. She had served as the head of diversity in the Arts Council  and authored her justly famous work titled The Art Britain Ignores: The  Arts of Ethnic Minorities in Britain (1976). This document, published by  the Arts Council, provided the first real challenge to funding bodies.  Following the success of her book, which went into numerous reprints,  Khan founded the Minorities Arts Advisory Service in 1976 and became  involved in the multicultural policy debate as it pertained to minority  arts in Britain.12 Dove explained that after publication of Khan's book,  it became apparent to Arts Council officers that a less essentializing  term than "ethnic" and a more generic label than "Indian" was needed  to encapsulate the rich heterogeneity and diversity of contemporary  Indian, Asian, Pakistani, Chinese, and African dance forms present in  the British diaspora.   We sat down in a noisy bar in Bergen and took a trip down mem   ory lane. Dove recalled the East-West Dance conference held in Mum  bai in 1984, which is when I first met him, and spoke at length about  the spread of the contemporary Indian dance movement to the United  Kingdom in the 1980s. He then told me the well-known story of the  brave Indian dancer Tara Rajkumar, mentioned above. A renowned  bharatanatyam and kathakali dancer, Rajkumar arrived in London in the  1970s and pioneered a new, multicultural arts movement in the United  Kingdom.13 Her path was not strewn with roses, but she persisted in  true pioneer spirit, reaped a small grant from the Commission for  Racial Equality, and established the first National Academy of Indian  Dance in London in 1979 (NAID).   Khan joined forces with Rajkumar. She served as a founding  member of NAID and helped Rajkumar realize her ambitious, multi  cultural vision for dance.13 Dove likewise was associated with NAID in its  early days because of his broader interest in Indian and contemporary  dance practice. Drawing on support from both figures and from many  others?including Tania Rose, an officer of the Commission for Racial  Equality, and Robin Howard, then director of the London School of  Contemporary Dance?Rajkumar organized two conferences: The  Contribution of Indian Dance to British Culture (1982) and The Place of  Indian Dance in British Culture (1983). As part of the conferences, NAID  conducted an education workshop on the Ramayana, including exhibi  tions and performances: "School after school brought children to learn  about Indian dance concepts. A booklet was published and slide series  on the Ramayana produced, illustrating the art of storytelling through  dance" (Rajkumar 2006). In this way, NAID endeavored to integrate  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    The Transfiguration of Indian/Asian Dance   309   Indian dance into mainstream British culture and society as early as  the 1970s.14   The Vision of Two Women and a Man  Two women and a man?Naseem Khan, Tara Rajkumar, and  Simon Dove?were implicated in the momentous expansion of Indian  dance into South Asian dance in the 1980s. If Dove located Indian  dance within the South Asian label, Khan positioned Indian dance  within the category of ethnic arts and cultural diversity, and Rajkumar  nestled Indian dance within the broader discourses of British multi  culturalism. While the trio did not conceive the South Asian label, the  label having emerged with the British decolonization of India discussed  above, they must be seen as formative figures who desired to enlarge  the Indian category if only to enable the mainstreaming of Indian/  Asian/ethnic dance in Britain. To realize their vision, the trio collabo  rated with the British Arts Council and other national organizations,  spoke persuasively on behalf of Indian/Asian/ethnic arts forms, and  created a new, intercultural openings for Indian/Asian dance in the  United Kingdom.   Drawing on Raymond Williams's theorization of culture, I mark  this formative stage when Indian dance emerged under the triple label  of Indian/South Asian/ethnic dance as representing the first emer  gent phase in the institutionalization of Indian dance in the United  Kingdom. Williams explains that historical and analytical studies of cul  ture must include an analysis of what he calls "formations," which are  recognizable as conscious movements and tendencies (literary, artistic,  philosophical, or scientific). In his own words: "Often when we look  further, we find that these are articulations of much wider effective  formations, which can by no means be easily identified with formal  institutions, or their formal meanings or values and which can even  be positively contrasted with them. This factor is of the greatest impor  tance for what is habitually specialized as intellectual and artistic for  mations" (Williams 1977: 119) It is important for dance scholars inter  ested in historicizing the institutionalization of Indian/Asian dance in  the United Kingdom to focus on NAID's emergence as an intercultural  institution because the organization brought to the fore a specialized  class of professional interlocutors, whom I would describe as intercul  tural arts administrators. These experts did not merely professionalize  the production of Indian/Asian arts in the United Kingdom, but also  could speak persuasively on behalf of the performing arts and restage  them within new, socially relevant theatrical and intellectual frames  of reference. Serving as intercultural interpreters and translators, this  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    310   Meduri   new group of traveling cosmopolitan arts administrators international  ized and cosmopolitanized the production of Indian/Asian arts in the  United Kingdom in the 1980s.   Thus, when Rajkumar and Dove left the United Kingdom to   settle in Australia and the Netherlands, respectively, Khan and Gopal  served as joint directors of NAID and stepped in as new local/global  arts administrators. They handed over the reins of this pioneering  intercultural institution to Mira Kaushik in 1988. Although Rajkumar  refers to the fledgling institution she founded as NAID, it needs to be  noted that the term "national" was appended to it after Rajkumar left  for Australia, when Khan and Gopal took over the directorship of the  institution.   NAID's Transformation into Akademi,  a Postcolonial Institution in the  United Kingdom (1988-2000)  In 1988, Kaushik was appointed director of NAID and took   charge of the institution by deleting the term "National" from the  institutional history of NAID. Kaushik explained that the term was too  ''grand and created a deception of grandeur untrue to the realities  of a small struggling charity."15 In 1997, Kaushik dropped the term  "Indian" and changed the spelling of "Academy" to Akademi: Academy  thus became Akademi: South Asian Dance in the UK.16 By dropping  the Indian label and respelling Academy Kaushik did something quite  exceptional. She presented her institution not as an "Indian national  Academy" but rather as a hybrid, postcolonial "Akademi" defined itself  within the double history of Indian and European nationalisms alike.  Briefly, after the declaration of Indian independence in 1947,   the Indian nation-state established Indian national Akademies to fos  ter the development and dissemination of Indian performing arts on  a national scale. The Indian Akademies for the arts are based on the  Western concept of government patronage provided through acad  emies, the most explicit model being the French Academy (Erdman  1984: 77-98). The French name, however, was thought to be inappro  priate in the Indian context and thus was deliberately misspelled to  read as Akademi and not Academy.17 Krishna Kripalani criticized the  Indian government for coming up with such a hybrid name that had  no legitimate genealogy?borrowed first from Plato's Academy, then  from French Academy and also from the Royal Academy of Arts?and  noted his objections in this way: "Why then was the name borrowed,  and what is more, why was it uglicized as Akademi for no better reason  than the Greek word had been adapted in Arabic and through Arabic  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    The Transfiguration of Indian/Asian Dance   311   into Urdu. Inscrutable are the ways of authority, be it divine, or earthly"  (Kripalani 1985: 168).   It was this hybrid term, disdained for its uglicized hybridity, that  Kaushik picked up from the dustbin of postcolonial history and reused  with grave seriousness in 1997. Yet she proffered an explanation for the  name change that had little or nothing to do with India or the postco  lonial Indian nation-state, but had everything to do with Akademi's dia  sporic work in Britain in the 1990s. Akademi explained that since the  organization was working with a large number of educational establish  ments and local boroughs around London that were ethnically diverse,  the two terms "national" and "Indian" were found to be limiting and  restrictive. By excising both the national and Indian labels, Akademi  presented itself as a hybrid postcolonial organization that was neither  Indian nor European, but something emerging from within the double  historical legacy of the two master names.   But why did Akademi accept the South Asian dance label in  1997? This is a question to which there is no satisfactory answer because  Kaushik herself, alas, did not seem to have much choice in the matter.  As explained in her interview with me, the South Asian label was already  in mainstream circulation in the 1980s, before she took up her post in  1988. Kaushik then really had two options: she could either accept or  refuse the South Asian label. She accepted the term because she wanted  Indian arts forms to find a home in mainstream British society and also  because postcoloniality is not born and nurtured in a panoptic distance  from history. Gyan Prakash explains that "[t]he postcolonial exists as  an after, after being worked over by colonialism. Criticism formed in  this process of the enunciation of discourses of domination occupies a  space that is neither inside nor outside the history of western domina  tion but in a tangential relationship to it" (Prakash 1992: 8).   After the renaming, Akademi enlarged the Indian category by  transnationalizing the vision of the institution. Akademi built partner  ships with London-based organizations in this time, but also created  separate and complementary departments of education, community,  dance training, and dance development. Its dance training research  led to the creation of a South Asian dance faculty at the Imperial Soci  ety of Teachers of Dancing and the development of internationally  recognized syllabi for classical bharatanatyam and kathak. At the same  time, Akademi created the opportunity to specialize in South Asian  dance at the London Contemporary Dance School and envisioned a  new bachelor of arts degree (honours) in contemporary South Asian  dance (Akademi 2006).   I mark this moment of the self-conscious enlargement of the  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    312   Meduri   Indian label to embrace the South Asian category as representing what  Williams has described as the dominant phase in the history of the  institution. Williams explains that dominant cultures are articulated  through "the incorporation of the actively residual?by reinterpreta  tion, dilution, projection, discriminating inclusion and exclusion"  (Williams 1977: 122). By incorporating the intercultural vision of NAID  into Akademi and elaborating on both, Akademi was able to enlarge  and particularize, homogenize and heterogenize its activities in ways  not imagined by NAID.18 Bhabha remarks on the creative leadership  provided by Akademi in this way:   Akademi beautifully bridges the classical and the contemporary. It  turns dance into a greater social performance that reflects the best cre  ative traditions and tensions of living in a multicultural metropolis, in  a world where tradition and innovation require a transnational stage.  In this adventure of the body and the spirit, Akademi takes a lead by  showing us that it is only through acts of cultural translation that we  can both display our cultural differences and share in a wider solidar  ity of historic and cultural commitment. (Bhabha 2006)   Akademi's Arrival as a Transnational, Diasporic  Institution in the United Kingdom (2000-2007)  In 2000, Akademi arrived on the London scene by spectacal  izing Indian dance as South Asian dance and enlarged its impact on  British audiences. In this third stage, Akademi sponsored large-scale,  site-specific productions, which were staged in South Bank, Somerset  House, and Trafalgar Square. Akademi produced Coming of Age (2000),  which took place on the walkways of the Royal Festival Hall in London.  More than seventy dancers performed Indian classical, fusion contem  porary, and folk dancing to packed audiences. This was followed by  Escapade (2002), which transformed the placid exterior of the South  Bank Centre and celebrated South Asian dance in a storm of color.  Waterscapes (2004) took the splendor of the Mughal Court to the foun  tain courtyard of Somerset House, and Sapnay-Dreams (2005) banished  pigeons from Trafalgar Square with a swirl of diverse dance styles shift  ing seamlessly one to the other:   Akademi's extravaganzas changed the profile of Indian/South Asian  dance and projected dance forms neither as traditional ritual nor cul  tural forms, but rather as protean, interdisciplinary, evocations comb  ing folk with Bollywood style dancing, and classical with the contempo  rary. The new interdisciplinary vision, sponsored by Akademi, inspired  dancers and choreographers to work freely with dance vocabularies  and envision site specific works.

Still others pursue a career in com  munity dance, teach and perform dance in schools, and prisons, youth  centres and hospitals. (Akademi 2006)19   Tourists visiting London are astonished by the bewildering  heterogeneity in dance production in the United Kingdom, as they  can see contemporary and classical kathak, bharatanatyam, bhangra,  or Bollywood performed in different mainstream venues in the city.  These forms are recognizably "Indian" because British dance-makers  continue to work with Indian dance vocabularies and techniques. Yet  British choreographers prefer to describe these as South Asian dance  choreographies. Do British dance makers use the South Asian label  because it is politically contingent to do so in the United Kingdom, or  because Akademi institutionalized Indian dance under that category?  What exactly is the relationship between the Indian and South Asian  labels? Is South Asianness just Indianness in disguise? These ques  tions cannot be answered satisfactorily because the dialectical tension  between the Indian and South Asian labels is not polemicized in the  practice, but maintained ambivalently and negotiated creatively both  by British arts administrators and dance makers alike.   Part II  Negotiating the South Asian Label in the  United Kingdom   Responding to Grau's essay (2001a), Uttara Coorlawala, a US   based dance scholar, has recently questioned British-based dance  scholars for taking on the South Asian label and replicating hegemonic  structures of power domination (2002). Coorlawala argues that the  South Asian label functions as a policing term and enables funding  agencies to control, shape, and domesticate the historical and cultural  identity of Indian dance forms:   The term includes but often glosses over geo-cultural and temporal  distinctions between the aesthetic visions and perspectives of diaspora  Indians (persons living in Pacific Asia, Africa, West Indies, the United  States, Australia, Europe, and in innumerable places on earth) and  dancers in or from India. . . . From my perspective, the phrase "South  Asian Dance" is repeatedly embedded within a discourse of pain and  anger, a discourse that interrogates whiteness, and negotiates a place  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    The Transfiguration of Indian/Asian Dance   315   for itself in a white driven power structure. . . . Self-determination,  the need to represent oneself, is precisely the source of my personal  discomfort with the term South Asian Dance.... Identifying character  istics and criteria might at first seem like a harmless aesthetic exercise,  but these have a way of cementing into criteria for funding allocations.  Policies of allocating funds, even responsive and flexible policies,  determine what forms of creative expression will be more visible than  others. (2003: 30-33)   Coorlawala thus puts out a call for action by urging British dance schol  ars to step outside structures of domination and critique the South  Asian label from the perspective of locational politics. While Coorl  awala's critique is insightful, she glosses over the important fact that  the South Asian label, in the moment of its articulation in the 1980s,  functioned as an inclusive and democratizing category in the United  Kingdom and made visible the dance forms of Indian/Asian minority  communities living in Britain. Coorlawala also fails to recognize the  uniquely individual manner in which British dancer/chorographers  negotiate with the South Asian label both in everyday dance training  and public performance.   It is true that, because of the large-scale public culture and aca  demic institutionalization and professionalization of Indian dance  as South Asian dance since the 1980s, dance scholars working in the  United Kingdom today cannot speak about Indian dance on its own  terms as it is now incorporated into or yoked into the category of South  Asian dance. The South Asian label, in other words, is hegemonic in  pedagogical and textual representation because it supplemented the  Indian term and asserted its dominion over the it.   Yet the hegemony of the South Asian label is called into question  by British Asian dancers and choreographers who willingly take on the  objectivizing and abstracting label but subjectivize and particularize it  in public performance. Gopal explained that while she uses the South  Asian label to speak and write about dance in the United Kingdom, she  resolutely teaches bharatanatyam as an Indian form. Sundaram likewise  uses the South Asian label selectively. While she does not use the South  Asian label in her public performances and refers to bharatanatyam by  its name, as editor of Pulse she uses the South Asian label to make dis  tinctions between British and Indian bharatanatyam.   If the South Asian term refers broadly to Asian dance forms   performed in the United Kingdom, the label is actually ethnicized  by Sri Lankan and Indian bharatanatyam dancers who drag the South  Asian label into their dance studios and imbue it with regional histo  ries, memories, and sounds. After ethnicizing and particularizing the  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    316   Meduri   abstract South Asian label in this way, British Asian dancers hail Indian  bharatanatyam or Sri Lankan bharatanatyam as South Asian dance.   I mark this doubling moment, when the Sri Lankan bharatanatyam  dancer transforms herself theatrically on stage into a South Asian  dancer, as being significant because it is here in this place of mistransla  tion that the dancer splits her identity, privatizes her cultural heritage,  and projects her public persona as a South Asian dancer, which was  given to her by the British nation-state. In "Dissemination: Time, Nar  rative and the Margins of the Modern Nation" Bhabha explains that  the pedagogical representation of the nation-state treats "a people" as  a timeless and essential object. Simultaneously, the nation is concep  tualized as a reiterative process of signification, constantly in flux as it  is enacted in the present?the performative. This double narrative is  what Bhabha refers to as the "splitting of the national subject" (Bhabha  1994: 145-146), characterized by perpetual movement between a time  of the past (the pedagogical) and the present (the performative).   In the case of the British bharatanatyam dancer, the pedagogical  is evoked in the South Asian label, which the dancer takes on willingly   Figure 5. Exit No Exit (2006) by Shobana Jeyasingh with dancers Deveraj  Thimmaiah and Yamuna Devi.

Jeyasingh aptly describes the lack of fit or disjuncture in  the South Asian label in this way (Figure 5). She explains that when  the Arts Council used the South Asian label to describe her work in  the 1980s, she thought it to be "less contentious" (compared to "ethnic  arts"), resting as it did "safely in the objective arms of geography." How  ever, being "pinned down" within such a rubric was discomfiting for  Jeyasingh, causing her to "wriggle" creatively, an exercise she identified  as a "supremely diasporic ritual" (Pinto 2004: 4).   Jeyasingh is uncomfortable and finds herself wriggling because   she is working within the folds of the South Asian label, which does  not speak to her identity either as Indian or Sri Lankan. Born in India,  she grew up in Sri Lanka and Malaysia and migrated to the United  Kingdom in the late 1970s. "A Christian in India, a Tamil in Sri Lanka,  an Indian in East Malaysia, and an Indian in Britain," she is, in fact, a  dancer-choreographer with multiple origins and labels. She thus com  plicates her migrant history in this way:   For me my heritage is a mix of David Bowie, Purcell, Shelly and Anna  Pavlova, and it has been mixed so subtly as a somosa has mixed itself  into the English cuisine in the last ten years or so: impossible to sepa  rate. But it is surprising how to many people my heritage could only  be Indian. . . . So, for me Purcell, like Shelly like David Bowie, is not  "the other,"?it is part of my heritage. And in dance terms, Rukmini  Devi and Merce Cunningham are also part of my heritage. (Jeyasingh  1998: 48)   While the South Asian label is too broad for Sundaram and  Gopal, the term is too narrow for Jeyasingh. Yet all dancers and chore  ographers working in the United Kingdom seem to be negotiating with  the South Asian label, particularizing the label in their practice and  performance, yet disavowing the private negotiation in public perfor  mance. In "A Sheltering Sky? Negotiating Identity through South Asian  Dance" (2004), Grau queries the South Asian label, yet concludes by  arguing that the label does provide a "sheltering sky" for South Asian  dancers in Britain.   I want to extend Grau's critique by suggesting that the South  Asian label manifests itself both as a "sheltering" and as an "alienating  sky" for South Asian dancers in the United Kingdom. The term is alien  ating because it functions as a disembedding term and does not refer  to any one country of origin. Neither is the term inscribed in poetic  history or legend, as is the case with India and Sri Lanka. Yet the "South  Asian sky" can be theorized as functioning like an "enabling, alienating  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    318   Meduri   metaphor" because it impels dancers and choreographers to embrace  not "real" but "imaginary homelands" and gives them permission to  invent multiple theatrical personae in performance.   Part III  South Asian Dance Pedagogy at Roehampton   I inherited the historical legacy of the South Asian label when I  became Convener of the new master of arts degree in South Asian dance  studies at Roehampton University in 2004. It is worth mentioning that  it is only recently that I took on my new identity as South Asian dance  scholar at Roehampton. For a long time before that, I was teaching in  the World Arts and Cultures Program at UCLA and in the Department  of Performance Studies at Northwestern University.20 Known as an  Indian/South Asian dance and performance studies scholar, I endeav  ored even in the United States to develop a transnational Indian/South  Asian pedagogy for bharatanatyam while also locating this form within  the history of Asian-American dance migration and diasporic forma  tion. Before that, I was living in India and was hailed there as classi  cal dancer or bharatanatyam/kuchipudi dancer. In the United Kingdom  in 2004, I had to reconceptualize dance scholarship developed in the  United States and make it relevant to the South Asian dance conceptu  alization as it was in the United Kingdom.   But the South Asian label was problematized immediately after  we launched the South Asian dance master of arts program in 2005.  Prospective Indian students interested in enrolling in the new South  Asian dance studies program began to ask probing questions about the  ubiquitous name: Why is Indian bharatanatyam hailed as South Asian  Dance in the United Kingdom? What is South Asian about Indian  bharatanatyam, or Indian kathak, or Indian odissi ? I hear the indigna  tion in their questions and dodge its ethnocentric charge by urging  students to think about the Indian and South Asian labels attached to  bharatanatyam as historical prefixes or brand names that help us think  the different institutionalization of dance forms in the world at large.  It is true that bharatanatyam visually encapsulates the "idea of  India" with its links to antiquity and history, which is why it was declared  as the "national dance par-excellence" after the formation of the post  colonial Indian state in the 1950s (Meduri 2007). Yet the national rep  resentation exceeded the boundaries of the nation-state when dancers  traveled with the representation through the global dance migrations  of the 1960s and 1980s. Like ballet, bharatanatyam manifests itself as a  bound and unbound, national and transnational form today, and it  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    The Transfiguration of Indian/Asian Dance   319   is performed both within and beyond national borders. Contempo  rary bharatanatyam dancers travel on the historical pathways created by  dance migration, hold dual passports and work permits, and shuttle  back and forth between India, Asia, America, and Britain.   At Roehampton, we study the dispersal of Indian/South Asian   dance culture in the world at large through the key heuristic frames  of travel, translation, and transformation. For us, South Asia is not  just a geographical region, but a metaphoric, historical, and theatri  cal space dispersing people of Indian/South Asian heritage and their  dance forms into the global world of diasporas. Marked as an unstable,  dangerous space on the world map, South Asia, in our perspective, is  a site for cultural experimentation, inspiring Asian immigrant dancers  to accept the inadequate South Asian census label given to them as pri  mary identity marker in the United Kingdom and to plot the different  migratory routes and travel trajectories though which they arrive here,  whether it be via Africa, the Caribbean, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangla  desh, the United States, or Canada.   In the South Asian dance studies MA program, students are  required to take two modules, titled Global Modernities and Global  Diasporas. In these modules, we take as exemplar case study Rukmini  Devi Arundale's world-renowned Kalakshetra institution and describe  how she self-consciously constituted an intercultural world vision for  bharatanatyam in the 1930s and reconfigured that vision in the Cold War  years to constitute a postcolonial, pan-Indian, and pan-Asian worldview  for Indian performing arts.   Briefly, Rukmini Devi Arundale, wife of Englishman George  Sydney Arundale, who served as the third president of the Theosophi  cal Society, whose international headquarters is in India, was not just  a dancer-choreographer but also an institution builder. One year after  her historic debut as a bharatanatyam dancer in 1935, Rukmini Devi  Arundale founded the International Academy of Arts (later renamed  Kalakshetra) to enable the revival of bharatanatyam (Meduri 2005a: 4  23). She yoked the art revival with the educational goals of the Besant  Memorial School, which she founded along with Arundale in 1934.21 In  the 1940s, Rukmini Devi established three other institutions, including  the Crafts and Weaving Centre, the Dr. U.V. Swaminatha Iyer (Tamil)  Library, and the Arundale Montessori Teachers Training College. All  five institutions were housed in different wings of the huge estate prop  erty of the Theosophical Society in Adyar. Rukmini Devi worked within  the domain of her five institutions and developed a pioneering art and  education movement that was both "local" and transnational simulta  neously (Meduri 2005b: 4-23).  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    320   Meduri   To realize her art and education vision, Rukmini Devi invited  international educators and hereditary dance and music teachers to  teach in the different institutions. She collaborated with both and  developed a multilingual and cosmopolitan world for bharatanatyam  that exceeded standard anthropological definitions of the local and  the "national" as early as the 1940s.22 Anthony King has explained that  "[t]he first substantial encounter between Europe and non-Europe,  between capitalist, and pre-capitalist, between white and non-white  peoples took place in what were to become the colonies, not the metro  pole"; these encounters were constructed under the very specific con  ditions of colonialism and were largely products of the specific social  and spatial conditions of colonial cities (King 1997: 8).   Rukmini Devi's intercultural vision was displaced by the promul   gation of what came to be known as the Theosophical Society's policy  of disassociation in 1950 (Meduri 2004: 11-15). The policy stipulated  that Rukmini Devi remove her five institutions from the grounds of  the society. Undaunted, Rukmini Devi purchased a hundred acres of  land in Tiruvanmaiyur, adjoining the Adyar estate of the Theosophical  Society, and rehoused her five institutions in this new location in the  1960s. In this moment of displacement, Rukmini Devi denied the his  toric rupture with the society and preserved the transnational history of  the Theosophical Society, albeit performatively in the new postmodern  habitus that she re-created for Kalakshetra in the 1960s.   Students from all parts of India and Asia, including Tibet, Sri   Lanka, Nepal, Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, and Japan, came to study  in Rukmini Devi's Kalakshetra in the 1960s. They were joined by inter  national students from Europe, Australia, America, Germany, and Eng  land. Completing their education, hundreds of Kalakshetra students  certified as dancer-teachers (a new discursive category that she articu  lated in the 1940s) returned to their respective "homes" in the global  world and taught and performed Kalakshetra-bharatanatyam in the  world at large. Suffice to say here that the South Asian dance faculty  in London, called upon to devise a South Asian ISTD syllabus in 1999,  drew upon the technique-based theoretical pedagogy that Rukmini  Devi had envisioned for Kalakshetra-bharatanatyam in the 1960s.   Although Rukmini Devi maintained Kalakshetra as a transcul  tural institution until her demise in 1986, the center came under the  protectionist custody of the Indian nation-state and was declared an  institution of national importance by an act of parliament in 1993.  Dance scholars have described Kalakshetra from within anthropologi  cal models of the local, the regional, and/or the national. But few have  gone beyond this to grasp the translocal vision of Kalakshetra.

I find the notion  of the translocal useful as it "speaks to the challenge of providing an  analysis of a global system of social relations without over-generaliz  ing or establishing hierarchies in which some sites are more global or  more important than others. Translocal analysis understands the links  between different locations to be unpredictable and contingent rather  than representative of a single transnational condition or national iden  tity" (Cvetkrovich and Kellner 1997: 25). Such perspectives enable us  to examine cultural production not just in terms of the Indian national  struggle but also in transcultural terms and help us to historicize the  different institutionalization of bharatanatyam both in the Western and  the Asian worlds.   Conclusion  I have been interested in names and labels attached to dance  forms since I began my studies in the United States in the late 1980s.  It is, in fact, by examining the politics and poetics of the renaming  of sadir, the dance of the devadasi, as bharatanatyam that I was able to  historicize the twentieth-century national institutionalization of Indian  bharatanatyam. My own dance theatre work has similarly focused on  acts of naming and unnaming.24 While I recognize the power struc  tures implicit in acts of naming and the complex ways in which labels  structure meaning, I have also learned to understand the provisional  ity of all labels, which are incapable of capturing the dynamism of live  performance.   Thus, for better or ill, I did not cling stubbornly to the Indian   label attached to bharatanatyam. I traveled instead in the tracks of Indian  dance migration and saw how the dance was institutionalized differently  in India, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Through my work  in three countries?I hold an Indian passport, an American green card  or permanent residency, and British work permit?I learned that the  South Asian label manifests itself as a spatial, hegemonic category in  both the United States and the United Kingdom. But I too learned, like  the four dancers described above, to wriggle with the Indian/South  Asian label and use it selectively to both mask and unmask its hege  mony in each and every act of private and public utterance. Gayatri  Chakravorty Spivak explains that "the deconstructive, philosophical  position (or postcolonial criticism) consists in saying an impossible no  to a structure which one critiques, yet inhabits intimately. The everyday  here and now of postcoloniality is a case of it" (Spivak 1990: 794).

From its early days, the insti  tute imported teachers from India and offered summer residency courses  in dance, music, languages, and yoga. The late Krishnaveni Lakshmanan,  alumna of Rukmini Devi Arundale's Kalakshetra institution, offered numer  ous residencies in the Bhavan. Two hundred of the eight hundred students  presently studying dance and music in the institution receive examination  based diploma and post-diploma certifications (Aubin-Parvu 2007: 18-19).

Its work is  modern and holistic, informed by the traditions and rich heritage of South  Asian dance and driven by the needs of South Asian dance artists in the United  Kingdom.   10. I interviewed Kaushik in 2004 at her office premises in London.  Akademi is currently funded by the Association of London Government, Lon  don Borough of Camden, Sony Entertainment Television Asia, the Paul Ham  lyn Foundation, the European Union, and Arts Council England.   11.1 interviewed Simon Dove in October 2004, when I met him at the  international conference on contemporary dance held in Bergen. Dove told  me that he was living in London in the 1980s and held leadership positions  at the Arts Council of Great Britain, Tara Arts Centre, and the Bhavan. An  experienced artistic leader, he combined a passionate engagement with inter  national contemporary arts practice, juxtaposed with a visionary approach  to commissioning, programming, and education. Most importantly, Dove  founded and directed the Vivarta Contemporary South Asian Performance  Festival and created a forum for contemporary Indian dance in the United  Kingdom as early as the 1980s. In 1998, Dove took over as artistic and general  director of Springdance, the international contemporary dance festival held  in Utrecht, Netherlands. In 2007, Dove left his home in the Netherlands to  join the Herberger College Dance faculty as chair (Dove 2007).   12. Naseem Khan was until recently a senior policy adviser for the Arts   Council and is currently working as a consultant and journalist. She set up  the black community newspaper the Hustler with friends; worked for the New  Statesman, the Guardian, and Time Out; and in 1976 founded the Minorities  Arts Advisory Service.   13. Rajkumar narrates her story in this way: "After arriving in London  in the 1970s, fresh out of college from India, the first few years were rather  bleak. Many were the miles I trudged performing and many were the days  when I felt I was facing an unyielding wall. But being an eternal optimist, I  focused on what lay beyond" (Rajkumar 2006). (Also see Akademi 2006 for its  retrospective website and Salidaa n.d.).   14. Grau describes in some detail the physical premises in which NAID   was working in its early days (see 2004).   15. See the narrative account titled "Restructuring the Akademi" for  a more complete explanation for the name change at (Salidaa n.d.) http://  www.salidaa.org.uk/salidaa/docrep/docs/projects/essays/dance/Akademi/  docm_render.html.   16. See Grau 2004 for a different discussion about the implications of   Akademi's name change.   17. A huge controversy about the appropriateness of choosing a colo  nial name and then indigenizing it was raised as a problem as early as the  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    324 Meduri   1950s, and the debate continues to this day. Yet nothing has been done to  change the name, and it is still used as such in India.   18. As such, 1988 to the early 1990s was a period of consolidation for  Akademi. This was executed through establishing partnerships with other  arts and dance organizations, which transformed Akademi into a more main  stream, London-focused professional organization.   19. From its early days as a provider of evening classes to its transforma  tion into a touring company in the mid to late 1980s, Akademi was focused on  cultivating an enthusiasm for the art form, filling a gap in service provision,  and building audiences for South Asian dance.   20. See Meduri 2004, in which I mention some of the modules I devel  oped to teach Indian dance in the Department of Performance Studies at  Northwestern University.   21. Rukmini Devi combined the visions of the two centers and articu  lated a transnational art and education movement known as "Education with  out Fear, and Art without Vulgarity" that exceeded standard definitions of the  local as early as the 1940s (Nachiappan 2001: 18). C. Nachiappan, who worked  with Rukmini Devi from 1940 until her demise in 1986, describes the transna  tional art education movement in this way. "Arts were an integral part of the  school system and enabled great experiments in education, like introducing  the Dolton system of education in which children learnt by themselves without  too much interference from teachers. It is here that Dr. Montessori conducted  her first Indian Montessori course and experimented with the advanced Mon  tessori Method for 6-12 year old children" (2001: 18).   22. By the 1940s, Kalakshetra became famous for the galaxy of tradi   tional teachers that Rukmini Devi gathered in her institution (Ramani 2003).  Since the traditional teachers recruited in the institution were well versed in  such diverse fields as dance, music, painting, weaving, painting, Sanskrit lan  guage, drama, and folk arts, Rukmini Devi urged them to teach from within  their fields of expertise and specialization. She thus envisioned a multidisci  plinary, cosmopolitan institution of the kind unknown in South India in the  1940s: one in which education, crafts, music, dance, painting, and research  coexisted.   23. This research was supported by the Ford Foundation. As part of  the Ford Foundation Fellowship, I curated Rukmini Devi's photo archive and  presented it in New Delhi, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Tokyo, Melbourne,  and London. I also scripted and staged Rukmini Devi's biography as dance  theatre. Titled Birds of the Banyan Tree, the theatre performance was presented  in India, the United States, and the United Kingdom. (Meduri 2005a).   24. As part of my doctoral research in the United States, I developed  a postcolonial historiography for classical bharatanatyam and focused on  the name question. I described how sadir-bharatanatyam was collapsed into  bharatanatyam in the 1950s and exported as such in the cultural exchanges  that India negotiated with the United States and United Kingdom in the 1960s  (see Meduri 1988, 1996, 2007). After completing my doctoral thesis, I adapted  my thesis into a postcolonial play and described how the Indian historical  This content downloaded from 63.235.188.31 on Mon, 14 Oct 2019 12:50:20 UTC  All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms    The Transfiguration of Indian/Asian Dance 325   temple dancer, known as devadasi, was translated and transnationalized in the  nineteenth century practices of British colonialism. Titled God Has Changed  His Name, the bilingual play was premiered in India in 1997 and was presented  in twenty-four cities across India in mainstream theatre venues, schools, and  colleges. See Seagull Theatre Quarterly (1999: 29-51) for a discussion about the  play and issues raised in the performance. Also see Spear and Meduri 2004 for  a discussion on the hybridization and transnationalization of devadasi dance  practices.   REFERENCES   Akademi. 2006.

Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 1 of 13                                                 Religious Dogma or Political Agenda? Bharatanatyam and its Reemergence in British  Tamil Temples       Ann R. David       In British Tamil temples, the increasing religiosity and sacredness of temple ritual alongside the growth of  Bharatanatyam1 dance performances presents a new discourse of performed Tamil Hinduism. Do these devotional  spectacles provide confirmation of a diasporic Tamil identity, and are these contemporary dance practices linked in  any way to the earlier temple dancers (the devadasi)? 2 How are these dances perceived by current devotees,  priests, and performers? What are the political implications of these resurgent religious sensibilities, and do they  support a "globalized localism" as Joanne Waghorne (2004: 171) puts it, where local, once-rural practices are being  exported throughout the Tamil diaspora? And what of the presence and influence, if any, of the political organization  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (ITTE) in temple religious and cultural practices?               Using evidence from my ethnographic research in London Tamil temples and local London Tamil  communities, 3 in this paper, I address the complex discourse of religious and political identity articulated in the  London Sri Lankan Tamil community, particularly in relation to dancing and ritual performance. I seek to answer the  aforementioned questions regarding the place of dances and dancing in defining such identity. I note expansions in  the transmission and performance of the classical dance form of Bharatanatyam in British temple locations and  interview dance students and performers. I investigate whether changes in temple and ritual practices and their  accompanying dance forms are aspects of an expressive culture that reaffirm or perform religious faith, or whether  they express a growing adherence to Hindu scripture and a dominant religious nationalism.               I consider the historical relationship of Bharatanatyam to temple practice, as well as the history of the Sri  Lankan Tamil diaspora and that community's particular postcolonial settlement in Britain. These discussions are set  within a theoretical framework that examines notions of diaspora and concepts of cultural, ethnic, and religious  identity. I note new, fluid notions of identity among second and third generations of British Asians and consider them  within the context of ethnicity and religious sentiment. Finally, I argue that a detailed understanding of Tamil dance  practices and their relevance to the Tamil community not only acknowledges their presence in Britain but also  reveals the significance of the dance forms within a political agenda.       Tamil Migration to the U.K.   Tamil migration from Sri Lanka to Britain separates into four main waves: the first, a postindependence migration  after 1948 of professionals and younger Vellalar (high-caste Brahmin) Tamils arriving for university education. From  1960, as discrimination increased and ethnic relationships in Sri Lanka began to break down, more young Tamil men  migrated to Britain. The escalation of Singhalese violence against Tamils in the early 1980s brought a third large  wave of asylum seekers and refugees, which continued into the 1990s. The advent of the new millennium brought a  change in migration trajectories--a marked decline in asylum migration but an increase in the regrouping and  relocating of family clusters, particularly of Tamils from Europe (France, Switzerland, and Germany) to Britain. This  secondary transnational migration has perhaps been propelled by the attraction of an English education for the  younger generations and by the obvious support of a well-established, significant British community that includes not  only Tamils from Sri Lanka but also from India, South Africa, Mauritius, Singapore, Trinidad, and Malaysia. No  accurate numbers are available, but they are thought to total around one hundred fifty thousand to two hundred  thousand people.4 The London Borough of Brent, in the northwest of the city, is home to the largest number of Sri  Lankan Tamils, calculated to be in the region of twelve thousand. Brent is one of London's most culturally diverse  boroughs where nonwhite ethnic groups now form the majority of the population. Other major settlements of Tamils  in Greater London are in East Ham, Merton, Surbiton, Tooting, and Croydon. The community itself is not   http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/14.4/david.html  6/16/2009   Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 2 of 13  homogeneous, however, with significant differences in caste, social status, educational backgrounds, and migratory  histories.               The first wave of Tamil settlers, for the most part, did not get involved in politics, as their energies were  focused on obtaining good educations and professional jobs and becoming established in the community--as many  studies on diaspora groups indicate (Safran 1991, Vertovec 1997, Wahlbeck 2002). However, the second and third  groups, having left a highly charged, volatile homeland, have been heavily committed to the Sri Lankan political  struggle, and the 1980s showed a rise in ITTE membership and its activities in Britain and the rest of Europe. 5  Although one or two academic studies have discussed the ITTE's long-distance control of the Tamil diaspora (for  example, Taylor 1994, Van Hear and Brun 20066), there is still little research that attempts to understand the current  role of the ITTE in shaping diaspora dynamics.               The links between the Tamil temples and political movements such as the ITTE, although implicit, are  significant. During the 1980s, British ITTE members held their annual puja (worship) at the Highgatehill Tamil temple  in north London, and during this same period, the Sri Muthumari Amman Temple in Tooting, southwest London, was  founded by a Jaffna-born Tamil sent to London by the Tamil Tigers. Working as a trained accountant, he was  financial controller of the ITTE in western Europe, responsible for coordinating the collection of funds from Tamils in  the European diaspora and for procuring weaponry. Waghorne notes that "the constitution of this temple stipulates  that any income above expenses be sent back to Sri Lanka for aid to projects" (2004: 218). Another temple in  Wembley, northwest London, received a £25,000 investment from the ITTE to help get it established. Since the  temples provide both ready access to the Tamil community and a potential source of income, the ITTE has sought  control over temple events, management, and revenue. 7 At all three of these temples, Bharatanatyam performances  by young Sri Lankan Tamil girls have taken place during festival occasions.               The continuing instability in Sri Lanka, the escalation of gang violence in London,8 and the general residue of  fear among the more recently arrived refugees certainly create an impact on the community here, as I found during  my ethnographic work in the period 2002–5. Despite an outward appearance of openness and warmth on the part of  the community, when I first attempted to arrange interviews, visit homes, or pursue questions further, I sometimes  met wary, somewhat guarded or evasive responses. My questions about the ITTE went unanswered, but this is  hardly surprising, considering the current political and historical factors at play.9 Chris McDowell noted similar  problems he encountered when asking questions related to the ITTE in his study of the Sri Lankan diaspora in  Switzerland, stating, "At this time and on a number of other subsequent occasions I received less than subtle  telephone calls and messages that were designed to refocus my research away from ITTE politics" (1996: 35).  There is no doubt that issues of resettlement, relocation, and dislocation feature powerfully in the lives of this  immigrant community, directly affecting social relationships, especially with outsiders such as myself, and the  transmission of their culture and religion.       Notions of Identity   How identity is constructed in a postcolonial, relocated diasporic milieu and the part played by dance practices in  transmitting, representing, or reworking these sociocultural and religious categories of identity are fundamental  issues in my research. Recent studies of South Asian dances and music in a diasporic setting reinforce the fact that  "expressive cultural forms and practices are central to any articulation of ethnic identity" (Hyder 2004: 12; see also  Nodwell 1996; Ram 2000; Katrak 2004, and Mackerras 2005), thereby confirming my own research findings on the  importance of dance praxis in British Tamil identity formation.10 In addition, research into British Bhangra music and  the new transnational Asian dance music (Sharma et al. 1996, Dudrah 2002) has examined the contested locations  of South Asian identity in urban Britain and noted how these layered identities are articulated through the medium of  music, in a trajectory similar to that of the dance.               Identity's 'double implication'--uniqueness and sameness--and the question of how people are categorized  and how they form their own self-ascription are essential factors that require unpacking in today's 'crisis of identity'  experienced by many diaspora groups (Hall 1994: 274). In Tamil Hindu groups, stakeholders in upholding tradition-- that is, first-generation immigrants and some of the older second generation--place a high value on traditional  dances and music as a vehicle for achieving and expressing Hindu identity. Interviews with my respondents have  revealed that boundary maintenance among Asian ethnic groups as theorized by Fredrik Barth (1969) and more  recently by Rogers Brubaker (2005) remains a tool of this diasporic situation. An obvious example is through the use  of language: the predominance of spoken Tamil in the Tamil temples and weekend schools asserts a distinctiveness  that distances non-Tamil speakers.               Brubaker notes that there has been an explosion of academic interest in diasporas since the 1980s, leading  to an attenuation of the original meaning of the term. He argues, however, that three core elements still remain--that  of dispersion, of homeland orientation, and of boundary maintenance (2005: 5–6). Boundary maintenance among  migrants is to be expected, states Brubaker, only becoming relevant to sociological studies when it persists into the  second, third, and subsequent generations. The maintenance of a distinct identity in the Tamil case by the second  generation reveals that assimilation and boundary erosion are still being resisted.               For many Sri Lankan Tamils in London, particularly the older generation, the classical South Indian dance  form of Bharatanatyam (in its postcolonial, revived mode) has become a marker of Tamil cultural and religious  identity. Young Tamil dance students from mixed socioeconomic backgrounds 11 substantiated this view when they  told me (in interviews and questionnaires) that "Bharatanatyam helps me learn more about religion" (Sahaana, age  thirteen), that "Bharatanatyam is part of my culture" (Geetha, same age), and that "it teaches you and the audience  about the gods of Hindu religion and prevents the culture and religion being forgotten, especially in the   http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/14.4/david.html  6/16/2009   Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 3 of 13  West" (Sophie, age sixteen). These statements reveal the traditional views the girls have been taught and do not  appear to be representative of second- and third-generation Asians discussed below. They are typical of a more  recently settled community.               The ascriptions of religious and cultural identity maintained through the medium of dancing are common to  many worldwide diasporic groups (see Cunningham 1998; David 1999, and O'Shea 2003). When examined, these  notions reveal a view of culture that is handed down from generation to generation and that shares customs, values  and beliefs. 'Culture' from this diasporic perspective is reified as a fixed and bounded object, despite the current  anthropological theorization of culture as a nonstatic, dynamic, and evolving "dimension of phenomena" (Appadurai,  1996: 13). Older respondents speak of the importance of their children in Britain learning the Hindu culture. These  articulations adhere to certain cultural beliefs and values and maintain a sense of difference by stressing embodied  customs as a property of individuals or groups. They allude to an embodied concept of the past in the gestures and  movements that belong, in the case of Bharatanatyam, to Tamil womanhood. We can find in the folding of a sari, the  applying of kumkum on the forehead, or the fluent and practiced gestures that plait the hair everyday familiar body  language of Tamil (and other Hindu) women that creates a feminized social body, and such gestures are included  throughout much of the abhinaya section of Bharatanatyam narrative dances. For example, the movements of the  nayika (heroine) in a story or myth show her dressing and preparing to meet her nayaka (hero) using stylized  gestures of the hands and face. The social body is directly represented in this manner in many of the dance  movements.               The adherence to concepts of purity and women's honor is also a dominant aspect of the Tamils' profound  commitment to and identification with their language and religion. Such adherence creates a type of moral  superiority manifest in their cultural as well as social practices (Thornton and Niththyananathan 1984, McGowan  1993), one that maintains a certain traditional and conventional view. These themes of the purity of their language  and culture--and the importance of women's chastity within Tamil civilization--have been held in high esteem by  Tamils throughout their history and remain influential throughout the Tamil diaspora, causing Tamils to remain united  across the world in their commitment to safeguard their language and culture (Pandian 1998). In dance practices,  this attitude is revealed in a widespread aversion to such hybrid forms of movement as Bollywood dance12 and the  retention of what is thought to be a purer form of Bharatanatyam such as that taught at Rukmini Devi's famous  dance school of Kalakshetra, near Chennai, India.13 Several of the London Tamil dance teachers I interviewed  presented the dance school of Kalakshetra as the epitome of authenticity, using features of the Kalakshetra style as  criteria to judge standards of Bharatanatyam performance--a way of invoking the past to interpret the present.       Bharatanatyam in Temple Ritual   A group of six teenage Tamil girls ascend the tiny stage in the hall of the London Sri Murugan Temple, in East Ham,  east London. They are dressed in bright, matching silk costumes of Bharatanatyam dancers, with gold jewelry,  braided hair, flowers, and anklet bells, the epitomÿ of Tamil femininity. The occasion is the annual Hindu religious  festival of Navratri, a nine-night celebration of the feminine power of the divine for which the girls have been  preparing during the past several weeks. The taped music starts, and they begin with a traditional introductory item,  the Alarippu, an abstract, highly rhythmically repetitive piece (author's field notes, 2004).               In addition to performances of Bharatanatyam at festival times such as this, there is an increase in the  provision of Bharatanatyam classes for young Tamil women, both in Britain and in the worldwide Tamil diaspora  (Cunningham 1998; Ram 2000; Katrak 2004, and Chakravorty 2004). Many of these classes take place within Tamil  temples or in adjoining halls. These classes allow the transmission of traditional culture and assist immigrants in  maintaining Tamil identity in local diasporic settings such as Britain, where the acquisition of Tamil social, cultural,  and religious values does not necessarily take place. By contrast, in India or Sri Lanka, these values are reinforced,  often subconsciously, throughout a child's upbringing. Anthropologist Kalpana Ram argues that the conscious move  to transmit and represent heritage through cultural practices indicates that there is already a sense of loss, a  breakdown of the continuity of that birthright (2000: 262). In my interviews, first-generation Tamil immigrants to  Britain frequently alluded to their concerns at the compromises made in their children's cultural upbringing because  of both internal and external pressures, and many now actively direct or organize classes for the young people to  learn their language and culture. 14               My research suggests that the presence of Bharatanatyam dance classes at several major London Tamil  temples signifies a new link between the dance and religious ritual and religious expression in the contemporary  diasporic setting. It also signifies the increased importance assigned to the dissemination of dancing within religious  practice. Bharatanatyam is currently being promoted as an important subject for study in three of the main London  Tamil temples. Many community elders, dance teachers, temple devotees, and religious leaders consider it to be  relevant to religious festivals in several other Tamil temples where performances by teachers, professionals, and  students can be seen. It is taught at most of the Tamil Saturday and Sunday schools, some of which have significant  links with the ITTE. The senior Hindu priest at the Murugan Temple in East Ham, London, is adamant that  Bharatanatyam belongs in the temple, believing it to be a rich and devotional vehicle for true worship, a gift to the  deity. He told me that classical forms of dancing and music should be supported and nurtured by the temples  (interview, February 13, 2003).               This same conviction about the essential place of cultural activities within the temple was stressed by one of  the music teachers at London's Bhavan Centre. 15 She is convinced that, unless the temples play their part in  encouraging the teaching and performance of traditional practices, these forms will die out. Her view is that art,  culture, life, and worship of God cannot be separated and that the temple is the most suitable location for endorsing  such spiritual and cultural expression. She spoke of a tradition of sacred hymns called Panchapuranam that were  always sung as part of temple worship (interview, April 5, 2002). In the past, it was believed that, unless these were   http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/14.4/david.html  6/16/2009   Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 4 of 13  sung during the ritual (puja), the puja was not complete. Her concern is that the majority of young Hindus are not  aware of these devotional songs, and so, during the Mahasivratri (Great Night of Siva) celebrations at the  Highgatehill Murugan Temple in March 2002, some of her students sang two of these traditional bhajans to Siva. 16  A Bharatanatyam dance offering followed the recital, the first of its kind to be held in that temple.               Explicit attention to the transmission of dances, music, and religion as signifiers of tradition, history,  nationalism, and ethnic identity creates a new definition of Hindu femininity in the diaspora--one that is considered to  be all the more important in the face of Western influences. For the Tamil middle class, Bharatanatyam promises  respectability and a traditional femininity and is, therefore, a prized carrier of tradition viewed in this way. Andrÿe  Grau, in her report on South Asian dance in Britain (2002: 7) 17 notes that Bharatanatyam is the most privileged,  classical Indian dance form in Britain and is generally recognized today as a transnational and global form. However,  in the predominant Sri Lankan Tamil temples and Tamil weekend schools in London, the teaching remains  dominated by local modalities. The students are neither encouraged to attend international performances of South  Asian dance nor are they made aware of the work of well-known performers in London and elsewhere in the U.K. In  addition, most syllabi are written in Tamil, and the dance classes taught in Tamil, even though the second- generation students are more familiar and more at ease with the English language. 18               This leads one to ask whether these Tamil community dance practices embedded in a religious setting are  part of a cultural expression that unites dancing and religious practice. Are they distinct from the secular  performances I witnessed in professional productions of South Asian dance in Britain and elsewhere? In partial  answer to these questions, I present a brief discussion of the legacy of the devadasi dancers, a subject well  documented by international scholars (Srinivasan 1983, 1985; Kersenboom 1987, 1991; Gaston 1996, and Meduri  1996, 2001). Examining the story of the devadasis and comparing it with today's South Asian community dance  practices reveal some interesting parallels. The relationship remains an ambiguous one, as the complex, contested  history of the original devadasi temple dancers indicates.               The devadasis ('gift to god') were professional dancers and ritual specialists, who performed at temple  rituals, temple events, and secular performances outside the temple complex, such as weddings. Indian literature  provides sources as early as the fifth century CE, where descriptions of dancing girls in both temples and courts may  be found. At certain periods in history, some of the larger South Indian temples would have employed hundreds of  devadasis (Marglin 1990: 215; Fuller 1984). 19 Devadasis were found in many regions in India and their practices  related to their local region and to the particular religious tradition to which they were attached. They had duties and  obligations as part of their professional status and received financial rewards for their services from wealthy patrons.  Some were themselves so wealthy that they could endow South Indian temples. Performances by devadasis  continued into the early part of the twentieth century, despite growing opposition from the "antinautch campaigners."  20 During the reinvention and renaming of the dance form, from sadir devadasi dance to Bharatanatyam in the 1930s  by Rukmini Devi and others, dancers would no longer perform for money. 21 This was a move to distance  themselves from the so-called disreputable dancers, who, it was thought, were taking money for prostitution.               Despite the demise of devadasi dancing in the first half of the twentieth century, there is evidence that  different strands of devadasi temple dance are being transplanted and replicated in the contemporary Hindu  diaspora in a creative manner, as I discuss below. This is not, of course, to suggest that girls are being sold or given  to the temples or that prostitution exists--far from it. Yet many of today's Bharatanatyam performances and  arangetrams 22 do unwittingly contain many elements of devadasi ritual, even though presented primarily on  Western proscenium stages and despite the tensions and contested history of the dance and its relationship with the  temple dancers. For example, we find evidence of Bharatanatyam dancers performing at weddings and social  celebrations and continuing the tradition of secular entertainment established by the devadasis. Now, however, it is  viewed as performance art and seen through the frame of a middle-class, chaste respectability.               Anne-Marie Gaston (1991, 1996) analyses the extent to which the new, evolved global community practice of  Bharatanatyam is based on the ritual performance of the devadasis. Aspects that had been rejected when the dance  was thought to be purified and made respectable by the South Indian reformers is now an integral part of  arangetrams and other performances, as I indicate below (see also Gorringe 2000, 2005; and Greenstein and  Bharadvaj 1998). Gaston points out that the ritual first lesson for the young devadasi, although not currently followed  in that form, has been replaced by a similar ritual offering of fruits, flowers, and gifts to the dance guru at the  commencement of study. The dedication of the bells on stage, the offering of flowers (pushpanjali), and the form of  the arangetram all follow the devadasi pattern. Gaston notes,   Other innovations of a quasi-religious type have also appeared. As a result, Bharata-Natyam has more  rituals and ceremonies attached to it today than it had during the period of its revival, when strenuous  efforts were made to dissociate it from sadir. (1996: 312)   Two of the many arangetrams I attended in London dedicated the first twenty minutes of the long evening to an  elaborate, onstage puja and the ritual blessing of the bells for the dancer and the talam. 23 Prayers were chanted,  offerings of fruit, flowers, and gifts made, and full obeisance performed by the dancer to her gurus, to the Hindu  priest, and to her parents, in front of a fully decorated shrine at the front left of the stage. In a later discussion with  one of the dance teachers, I learned that, if the families wished, a full puja was performed at the temple the day  before or on the morning of the arangetram, rather than on stage (author's field notes, March 12, 2003). During this  ceremony, the priest will chant Sanskrit verses dedicated to Siva, and the bells and costumes are blessed. Some of  the Tamil parents make a vow at this stage, that after their daughter's (or son's) arangetram, a performance will be  given to the temple as an act of devotion, called Samarparnam. Other aspects of arangetrams follow the traditional  devadasi or temple ritual; for example, the mallavi, a musical piece played on the nagaswaram exclusively for the  temple deities when they are brought out of the temple, is now choreographed for Bharatanatyam. At one  arangetram, this was played by the onstage musicians as the opening dedicatory item; on another occasion,  traditional temple musicians played the introductory music, using the nagaswaram (a double-reeded flute, like an   http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/14.4/david.html  6/16/2009   Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 5 of 13  oboe) and the tavil (a large, outdoor drum beaten with a curved stick on one side and the drummer's hand with metal  plectra on the other).24               Andrew Willford's (2002) research in Malaysia on Tamil Hindus during Tai Pusam 25 and Alleyn Diesel's  (2003) examination of the Tamil community in KwaZulu-Natal corroborate my findings that dance practices, including  trance dances, are a prominent part of the religious expression of diasporic Tamil communities, as I argue for the  British Tamil groups. In contrast, during her work with Canadian immigrant Tamil dance groups, Janet O'Shea found  that Bharatanatyam, rather than being a vehicle for religious sentiment and ethnicity, has become a medium for  political and nationalist views (2001: 131–34), a topic that I consider next.       Issues of Nationalism and War   In Britain, the dance practices in the Tamil community have tended to maintain a traditional, bounded, somewhat  monolithic view of Bharatanatyam where innovation is not encouraged. In other areas of Europe and North America,  however, there is evidence of Tamil Sri Lankan nationalism (and support of the ITTE) through change and creative  choreography in the dance form. For example, O'Shea's research (2001) in Toronto illustrates the work of two Tamil  dance teachers who promote the establishment of a separate state of Tamil Eelam (Tamil homeland) through their  Bharatanatyam choreographies. One produced a danced story about a military woman who sacrifices her male kin  to the ongoing Sri Lankan war. The other, Vasu, teaching "under the auspices of the Tamil Eelam Society, a  Toronto-based organization that exists primarily to provide social services for Tamil refugees but that also, as its  name implies, embraces a "'counter-state nationalist' … view of the Sri Lankan political situation" (ibid.: 131), created  a dance work that articulated a Tamil separatist nationalism and clearly associated Bharatanatyam with a solely  Tamil history. This choreography was created especially for the commemoration of Black Tigers' Day, 26 and  Bharatanatyam gestures were used to depict both agricultural work and fighting scenes of the war.               The growing significance, too, of the celebration of Mahavira (Great Heroes Day),27 when the fallen Tamil  heroes of the Sri Lankan conflict are honored, is evident not only in Sri Lanka but also in the worldwide Tamil  diaspora, where Bharatanatyam dancing has become an essential ingredient of the day's celebration. These events  are marked by elaborate ritual reminiscent of that in a temple or a traditional dance performance. Garlands are laid  and lamps are lit, but the garlands are offered to effigies of the deceased rather than to the gods, and the lamps are  lit by the families of the dead instead of by a priest. A particular occasion of this festival in Bologna, Italy, in  November 2000 included a performance of Bharatanatyam by young girls and women that enacted in story form the  violent struggles taking place in Sri Lanka, using gestures choreographed by their teacher to show warlike actions,  automatic weapons, bombs, helicopters, and prisons. 28               Here is an example of a religious and devotional dance form and religious practices such as rituals and  processions being appropriated for a political and nationalist agenda. O'Shea writes of how the ITTE in Sri Lanka  consciously cultivate a Tamil identity through the arts by sponsoring music and dance competitions and  commissioning revolutionary dance pieces, some of them danced by female cadres of the rebel forces (2006).  Creative choreography, innovative use of the conventional hand gestures, 29 and storytelling have become an  accessible vehicle for the Tamil refugee and diaspora community to express their solidarity and support for the war  and for the creation of a separatist state of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka.               Nationalist identity is for Tamils a multilayered, multivalent issue, particularly in the diaspora. Nira  Wickramasinghe comments:   Defining Tamilness in purely national/territorial terms is problematic today, as transnational factors play  a crucial role. Diaspora Tamils have multiple allegiances--to their new home in the West, to the land  they left and to the dream of Eelam--and in various ways they have forged close and organic links with  one form or another of Tamil nationalism. (2006: 254)   There is no doubt that these new rituals and cultural performances celebrating ITTE-linked events "have been  incorporated into the festivals of the diaspora Tamils … and link them with their imagined nation of Eelam" (ibid:  266), again encouraging a "globalised localism" (Waghorne 2004: 171). Posters advertising Mahavira's Day for the  Tamils settled in Toronto used the image of a Bharatanatyam dancer, thereby playing on both Tamils' great love of  and identity with their culture and on their history and collective memories.               Despite the local sense of place that dominates the London Tamil environment, there is evidence that Tamil  dance events there, too, are involved in the production of both local and global elements in relation to Sri Lanka. In  March 2005, the Sri Lankan Tamil community in south London hosted a program of music and dance to raise funds  for a new charity, Tamil Aid, an organization established in January of that year to help with the rehabilitation of  victims of the 2004 tsunami disaster in the north and east of Sri Lanka. The performers and audience were local  Tamil children studying music and dance at the Surbiton Tamil Temple (south London), who were supported by an  audience of their families and guests from the Sri Lankan community. The event was filmed by CeeITV, a global,  digital Tamil channel that broadcasts to British Tamils and transnationally, stressing once more the strength of the  local-global connections. The Sri Lankans' political sensibilities and cultural ties to their homeland are major factors  in their diasporic lives, not necessarily in the sense of a longing to return but as displaced people whose political and  financial support is devoted to rebuilding and supporting their homeland. Tamil globalization is, for the Sri Lankans,  an adherence to an articulation of Tamil nationalism. 30        http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/14.4/david.html  6/16/2009   Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 6 of 13  New, Fluid Identities   Recent theories of identity have addressed the complexity and hybridity of cultural identities being forged by young  Asians in Britain. These identities have been termed "new ethnicities" (Hall 1988), an expression indicating how  particular backgrounds, cultures, and experiences no longer bind these second- and third-generation Asians. As  anthropologist John Eade points out, new ethnic identities "point to a liminal third space--the boundary between the  opposites of insider/outsider" (1997: 147) where new narratives of belonging are negotiated. Concurrent with this is  evidence of a shift toward a fluid hybridization of identity, as boundaries are eroded among second and third  generations. The previously cited comments by young Sri Lankan Tamil girls, for example, contrast with the values  of young Asians for whom Asian and Western club music is an essential part of their distinctiveness and  individuality. Clubbing, attending music festivals, and driving in cars blaring loud music are modes of expressing a  modern, 'Asian Kool,' global identity, which may either sit happily with traditional practices or eschew them  altogether.31 Rehan Hyder comments that music, like the dance, is "a site of cultural negotiation and change, where  identities are performed and transformed" (2004: 5), suggesting this provides evidence of a more hybrid, adaptable  notion of cultural and ethnic identity.               It is also clear, however, that the Hindu communities settling in Britain are at variable points of change. This  is most evident with Gujarati Asians who have been well established in Britain since the early 1970s and some a  decade earlier. Thirty to forty years of residence in Britain--first marked by efforts for financial survival, then by the  successful formation of their communities, and followed for some by very prosperous business lives 32--have brought  significant changes to their social and cultural life. Modes of behavior are modified to suit the particular context, and  "most young Asians are very skilled at doing just this," writes Ballard (1982: 196). Wenonah Lyon's ethnographic  study of a multiethnic community theater group in Oldham, Greater Manchester, reveals how the British Asian  members of the group identified themselves by different names at different times, a use of assorted multiple  identities to suit the requirements of specific situations. At times, they would stress their religious affiliation such as  'British Muslim' or just 'Muslim,' 'British Hindu' or 'Hindu'; but in other contexts, they might choose the terms 'Asian' or  'Pakistani.' Lyon notes that the classifications they used included "Asians, British, black, white, by area of origin …  by sub-region within the area of origin … by religion … or language" (1997: 187).               A similar response to the concept of being British was found by Les Back in his ethnographic studies of  young working-class black and white groups in London. This study examined "new and challenging forms of cultural  practice and identity formation that had been produced within metropolitan contexts" (Back 1996: 3). Some  respondents were content with the terms 'black' and 'British' as an indicator of their identity; others had abandoned  the notion of 'Britishness' entirely. For many of them, the islands of origin of their parents featured as an important  aspect of their new ethnicity. Other black youngsters spoke what Back (ibid.: 8) terms a "harmony discourse,"  describing how color was of little importance to them and stating that everyone on the housing estate integrated  freely. Back comments that the youths' description was of "a place where people can move in and out of different  kinds of self-presentation" (ibid.: 8) as they willed (see also Eade 1997).               For many young people, their cultural identity is a syncretic, fluid amalgam of past and future, Asian and  British, black and brown--an identity that is multilayered and multifaceted. This more versatile, complex, and  developing sense of identity of the younger generations expresses notions of culture and religion that are more  personal and less circumscribed by the beliefs of preceding generations. It indicates an eroding of ethnic boundaries  and of a greater influence of globalization in areas such as music, fashion, religion, and politics.               In terms of religious identity, the study of second-generation Asians in Britain by Tariq Modood et al.  concludes that they are negotiating their own "religion of private spirituality" (1994: 50). Those interviewed  acknowledged religion to be important but felt it was a matter of personal spiritual fulfillment that each should find in  his own way, perhaps more in line with the dominant beliefs of the British population. Regular, formal worship and  attendance at the temple were no longer seen as a necessary structure in their lives, unlike the first-generation  groups. Eade's study of young Bangladeshi Muslims in London's East End shows that they inhabit a "more complex,  fragmented, deeply reflexive world where individuals can develop highly versatile interpretations of collective  solidarities" (1997: 161). I would suggest that we are seeing not a single phenomenon of religious beliefs held by  second- and, now, third-generation Asians but a highly variable articulation of selfhood that ranges widely from  conservative and devout religious affiliation to a comprehensive rejection of ethnic religious practice. Along this  continuum is a range of more individual viewpoints, which include such concepts as 'private spirituality,' 'personal  spiritual fulfillment,' and 'unstructured religion' (author's field notes).               Coupled with this are the vexed issues of cultural authenticity, where fixed ideas of an unchanging, traditional  dance form are held by some teachers, elders in the community, and religious leaders as if part of a cultural  essentialism. The dance performances at London Tamil temples have never included any creative or innovative  work, as first-generation settlers keep strict control on the presentation of traditional, classical items. Here, the  stakeholders who maintain tradition have also become the agents for preservation.       Concluding Comments   Among British Tamil groups, there is widespread evidence of a growth of dance activities that includes  Bharatanatyam training and performance as part of religious and devotional practice. This new discourse of  performed Tamil Hinduism raises questions about the role of such cultural practices within a religious setting,  revealing how traditional orthodox views seek to retain Tamil language, Bharatanatyam dance, and classical music  as part of a diasporic cultural and religious identity. There is indication that an increasing religiosity, apparent not just  in Hindu communities but among other religious groups--for example, Muslim and Christian--is not always free from  dogma or political agendas. These factors can be highly influential on a group's sociocultural expressions, as this   http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/14.4/david.html  6/16/2009   Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 7 of 13  paper has argued. In the case of Sri Lankan Tamils living in Britain, the unspoken presence of the ITTE in their lives  has both a positive impact in supporting and securing their hopes for a Tamil homeland (Tamil Eelam) and a  negative one, through experiences of intimidation and gang violence in the suburbs of London. I have also shown  how Bharatanatyam is being used as a political vehicle in other Tamil diasporic communities, while in Britain it is  seen by many as a vehicle for religious sentiments.               As I have discussed elsewhere (David 2007), younger-generation Asians are emerging in Britain who appear  to have no strong material, financial, or symbolic ties to their family homeland (whether India, Sri Lanka, or East  Africa) and who see themselves as British, British Hindu, or British Asian, straddling both cultures yet bound by  neither. These young Asians participate in a "global youth culture" (Saldanha 2002: 340) and hold a sense of global  identity, unlike their parents and grandparents who struggled to maintain their identity through establishing space  and place. These generations are resisting "the existing categories of ethnicity and identity … and articulating a  multi-accented sense of self and belonging," states Hyder (2004: 10). For some, a transnational identity has  meaning as a religious identity; for others, identity embraces a more complex, fragmented, and shifting sense of  selfhood. But there is no doubt that the forces of the local, national, transnational, and global elements continue to  effect a transformation on the lives of British Asians via their sense of ethnicity and their cultural practices.               This ethnographic study has sought to redress the marginalization of certain dance forms such as those of  the Tamil community, in religious contexts, and in the Hindu diaspora by gathering ethnographic insights at a local  level and questioning the embodied identities manifest in the social space of the dance practices. This investigation  of a British-based South Asian community not only exposes these particular traditions to a wider audience, enabling  the growth of a richer understanding, but places them in the extended international field of dance scholarship. It  reveals the value of a cross-disciplinary approach that draws from anthropology, cultural studies, folklore, and  religious studies and offers fresh insights into the place of ethnicity, identity, community, and aspects of cultural  transmission through the study of dancing.

The author would also like to thank  colleagues at the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) Conference in Bristol, U.K., in September  2006, for their comments on an earlier draft of this paper, as well as the editors and readers of this essay for their  suggestions and critical engagement with the text.       Notes:                   1 Bharatanatyam, originally known as sadir or dasi-attam, is an Indian classical dance style from southern  India. It developed in Hindu temples and was renamed (and some would argue, reinvented) in the 1930s. Its  contested history is well documented by scholars such as Amrit Srinivasan (1983, 1985), Avanthi Meduri (1996,  2001), Joan Erdman (1987), and Janet O'Shea (2001, 2003).               2 Devadasi is a shortened form of the Tamil word tevaradiyal, which translates as the "slave of the  God" (Srinivasan 1985). It literally means 'at the feet of the God' and is used to describe the hereditary female  dancers in South India who were dedicated to the temple at an early age and performed dance and ritual worship  before the deities.               3 I made frequent visits to six Greater London temples between 2002 and 2005 and again between 2006 and  2007 at festival times, at times of daily worship, and at other times, to meet devotees for interviews and discussions.  Methods used for gathering data included participant observation, in-depth and semistructured interviews, film,  photography, and audio recording.               4 One of the London Tamil leaders suggested these numbers during a discussion. Although it is a well-known  fact that insiders often exaggerate their numbers, the estimated number of Sri Lankan Tamils in the U.K. is also  given at one hundred fifty thousand to two hundred thousand on Brent Council's website (www.brent.gov.uk/brain :  accessed April 23, 2009). As the 2001 government census did not distinguish Asian places of origin, there is no  accurate record of the community's numbers. Danny Sriskandarajah (2002: 292) gives the total numbers of overseas  Tamils as approximately eight hundred thousand: four hundred thousand in Canada; two hundred thousand in  Europe; forty thousand in the U.S.; and thirty thousand in Australia, with the rest spread over several other countries.               5 The ITTE was designated a terrorist group in 2001 by the British government and later by George W.  Bush's administration in the United States.               6 Unpublished current research presented by Nick Van Hear and Catherine Brun at an informal workshop  day that focused on "Research on Tamils in the U.K." and was held in January 2006 at the Centre on Migration,  Policy and Society in Oxford (COMPASS), U.K.                 7 Human Rights Watch 18(1) (2006): 21.              8 Despite the fact that majority of the London Tamils live peacefully within their local communities, during the   http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/14.4/david.html  6/16/2009   Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 8 of 13  last several years, there has been a worrying escalation of violence between gangs of Sri Lankan Tamil youths in  London. By May 2002, there had been four violent deaths and up to two hundred other reported incidents; and in  August 2003, an eighteen-year-old Tamil man was murdered by other young Tamil men, the fifth to be killed in that  year. In 2007, two Tamil gang leaders in East Ham were jailed for extortion and violence in the community, and  others were subject to Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ABSO), banning them for five years from entering the London  borough of Newham (which includes East Ham).               9 It is important to note that, once I had been accepted into the Tamil temples, respondents' homes, and  Tamil Sunday schools, people were generous and helpful.                 10 See David (in press).              11 These girls I interviewed attended dance classes at the London Sri Murugan Temple in East Ham, east  London. Some parents are professionals--doctors, accountants, teachers--others own their businesses, such as  retail outlets, and some of their parents are employed in shops or petrol stations.               12 For further discussion of issues surrounding the practice and transmission of Bollywood dance forms in the  diaspora, see David 2007.                 13 Rukmini Devi founded Kalakshetra in the late 1930s at Adyar, just outside of Chennai, India.              14 Second-generation Asians are beginning to continue this work. One example of this is found at the Shree  Ghanapathy Temple in Wimbledon, London, where the son and daughters of the founder of the temple now assist  their mother in the financial, organizational, and cultural running of the temple. Geetha, in her thirties, arranges the  children's classes in Tamil, Hinduism, Bharatanatyam, and classical music, and she is concerned that they have a  good spiritual education at the temple. The classes were started originally when devotees at the temple asked for  them and are mainly offered for the four- to fifteen-year olds. The older teenagers are encouraged to help with the  classes (author's field notes, January 15, 2003).               15 The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, or Bhavan Centre as it is now known, was established in London in 1972 as  a British branch of the same organization in Mumbai. It is primarily a secular teaching institution, called 'Hinducentric'  by some, and values a traditional approach to the learning of classical forms of music, dance, and languages. Since  1975, it has been based in   premises in west London, using the site of an old church and newly enlarged adjacent buildings.               16 There is now also a group of adults at the Shree Ghanapathy Temple who are learning and performing  these devotional hymns. This group performed as part of the week-long ritual events at the London Sri Murugan  Temple during the consecration of their new temple in May 2005.               17 The SADiB report "South Asian Dance in Britain: Negotiating Cultural Identity through Dance" (2002) was  written at the end of a two-year research project (July 1999–July 2001) and funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The  project examined the role played by South Asian dance in Britain and was directed and the report written by  anthropologist of dance Andrÿe Grau, reader in Dance at Roehampton University.               18 The teenage girls in the Bharatanatyam class at the London Sri Murugan Temple were uncomfortable  speaking Tamil and spoke to each other and responded to their teacher in English, even though she addressed  them in Tamil. This teacher later explained to me that all her dance vocabulary is in Tamil and she is therefore not  confident of teaching in English (author's field notes, September 28, 2003). Not all ethnic groups place such a high  value on language maintenance as essential to ethnic identity. See M. K. David (1998) for research into the  Malaysian Sindhi community.               19 Saskia Kersenboom (1991), writing of her dance training by a traditional temple dancer, traces the  dancer's family back for four generations of devadasis to the early 1800s.               20 Antinautch campaigners followed the late nineteenth-century movement to abolish dancing in temples and  were "related to a larger Indian social reform effort driven by two separate groups pursuing rather different goals:  British Protestant missionaries and Indian social reformers" (O'Shea 1998: 50).               21 Much has been written about the reinvention or revival of Bharatanatyam in the 1930s in India. Rukmini  Devi played a central role in the revival, changing the content of the dance, the costumes, the training, and the  performance to establish a nationalist, respectable, middle-class dance style suitable for young women, transforming  it from a liturgical to a dramaturgical art form.               22 Arangetram is a solo, debut performance after many years of intensive training. The word arangetram is  Tamil and means the erru or ascending of the arangam or stage. It is written of in the third-century classical Tamil  text Cilappatikaram, where a twelve-year-old dancer is described giving her first performance before the king  (Gorringe 2005: 91). Instead of the arangetram's marking the commencement of a professional dancing career, as it  traditionally represented, it has become a marker of the completion of training when the young woman stops dancing  to go to the university or to take up a more lucrative professional career in medicine, dentistry, accountancy, or law.  (See also Greenstein and Bharadvaj 1998, and Schwartz 2004: 89). An arangetram, argues Gorringe, has become   http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/14.4/david.html  6/16/2009   Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement | Vol. 14 No. 4 | ANN R. DA...  Page 9 of 13  "a symbol par excellence of ethnic heritage … a cultural commodity" (2005: 97–98), enabling the parents to present  not only their daughter as an accomplished and marriageable young woman but to demonstrate their status and  wealth to the community at large.               23 Talam are the metal cymbals played to beat the foot rhythms in a Bharatanatyam performance by the  nattuvanar, who also speaks the rhythmic syllables.               24 These instruments were "traditionally the hereditary specializations of the Isai Vellala, [music landlords], a  politically powerful community of Tamil Nadu" (Srinivasan 1998: 3). They play as an accompaniment to the deities, at  times of ritual worship in the temple and at festival times, to initiate processions, and as a prelude to the deities'  arrival on the streets during processions. As their sound is powerful, they are considered to be outdoor instruments.                 25 Tai Pusam is an annual Tamil religious festival dedicated to the deity Murugan, Lord Siva's son.              26 The Black Tigers are the elite fighting force of the ITTE, trained to commit suicide in war and worshipped  as heroes upon their deaths.               27 This holy day's celebration was started in 1989 and then extended the following year to whole week. Its  purpose is to channel veneration for all ITTE martyrs.                 28 See Natali (2002).              29 For example, the hand gesture of alapadma, literally meaning 'an open flower,' has been used to depict a  hand grenade.               30 See David (in press) for extended discussion on the negotiation of religious identity in British Hindu  groups.                 31 On 'Asian Kool,' see Sharma et al. 1996.                32 See Barot (1991: 193).
