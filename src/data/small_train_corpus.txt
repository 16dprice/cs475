once upon time don worry we ll get to that one real quick throne of eldraine is almost here we re eating food and going on adventures and meeting all sorts of interesting fairy tale inspired friends and apart from the exciting flavor there bunch of power in the set waiting to be released on the standard format with four sets also leaving standard this is one of the biggest standard shakeups in long time meaning throne of eldraine is likely to make huge impact so without further ado here are my loves and hates for throne of eldraine hate once upon time where better to start don worry despite what the internet may be telling you every game of magic until the end of time in every format isn going to start with the words cast once upon time yes once upon time is free spell and yes free spells tend to be problematic however this is not just free ancient stirrings once upon time costs two mana which is what you re going to be paying for the card the majority of the time it also only finds creatures or lands further limiting its usage so we need to be playing green deck with good amount of creatures that doesn mind drawing random impulse over the course of game typically creature heavy decks tend to be aggressive or tempo based meaning spending two mana to not affect the board is death knell think about what tempo black hole card like discovery dispersal is so that the bad part what about the payoff when it actually in our opening hand we get to cast commune with dinosaurs off of our turn one temple of malady that it sure commune with dinosaurs is great and early game cantrips help to sculpt your gameplan and make your deck more consistent but at the cost of putting what essentially leyline into your deck and there the rub once upon time has more in common with leyline of void than ancient stirrings for some broken modern or legacy decks that are intensely interested in their opening hands and not much more sure once upon time is reasonable option for fair green decks in standard that are slow enough to not mind casting an impulse sure but the default thought on this card is going to be does my deck want this card not playing green so playing four once upon time once upon time will see play but the hype around this card is astoundingly overblown love murderous rider there really not much to say here the adventure cards are pure card advantage and swift end would have been playable if it was just instant with no extra text hero downfall was format defining card when it was last legal and two life is paltry price to pay for hero downfall that always cantrips into spell sure lifelink knight isn the best creature of all time for three mana but it literally just free bonus on top of your hero downfall furthermore if you re playing matchup where you don need removal spells is far better than dead card murderous rider is one of the best cards in the set for standard play however good you think it is promise you it is better love bonecrusher giant it little weaker on the front side and stronger on the back side but everything said about murderous rider applies to bonecrusher giant as well kill creature take your card advantage and then cast creature that may have been playable even without the adventure side while shock is certainly weaker than hero downfall you can also look at it as bonecrusher giant having sort of pseudo haste as the shock can always go upstairs when there are no good targets again one of the best cards in the set even if you like it you re probably underrating bonecrusher giant love savvy hunter okay let talk food in some ways food is similar to energy from kaladesh in that it somewhat parasitic cards that make food or care about food are mostly only going to work with other cards that make and care about food it certainly better design than energy because you can interact with the food tokens and they can do other things like trigger artifact or sacrifice synergies but for the most part food cards are going to want to stick together making food can be too difficult and there has to be something very good to do with your food how about drawing cards is that good savvy hunter is food tireless tracker so far looking like the best reason to want food tokens in your deck its body is already respectable and it can help with food creation as well but it going to get turbo charged once you start adding other food cards to the mix oko thief of crowns looks very good with savvy hunter in play while gilded goose helps to cast either card on turn two while also providing great enabler and payoff for food synergies but make no mistake if there food deck savvy hunter will be the most important card in the deck love slaying fire here real easy one mono red aggro is always deck slaying fire is essentially better flame javelin flame javelin was format defining card for mono red when it was legal in standard slaying fire will be too that it hate questing beast haven we heard this song before questing beast is cut from the same cloth as other green mythics like nullhide ferox it big it green and it has lot of words on it so many words that it evokes feeling of how could they print this however like nullhide ferox questing beast will see some play but not be anything close to what it hyped to be right now yes haste is very good yes it can be chump blocked by tokens and random small creatures yes vigilance and deathtouch are nice additions however that mostly it the planeswalker redirection text is nice touch but if you re in position to kill their planeswalker with your haste creature you re already in good spot regardless questing beast doesn help you get out of the bad spot where you can get through nor does it provide much aid when your opponent has good board presence and that the crux of questing beast it just medium sized idiot it still dies to removal spells it still can get stalled on gummed up board it still trades with other midsized creatures for no benefit it has no relevant creature types or synergies and it in the awkward spot at four mana of being bit too big for aggressive decks and bit underwhelming for midrange decks it also legendary which can be significant deck building constraint questing beast will certainly see play across it time in standard but its bark is much mightier than its bite love acclaimed contender there lot of tribal support for knights in throne of eldraine but tribal decks often need more than just good attackers and blockers enter acclaimed contender if knights is going to be successful deck in throne of eldraine standard it will be on the back of acclaimed contender sort of militia bugler goblin ringleader hybrid card acclaimed contender provides card advantage and board presence all together in one neat easy to cast package tribally relevant body is no joke and acclaimed commander is not only always going to find you spell but it likely to be good one knight decks will clearly be full of other knights but there are also some sub synergies between knights and equipment that acclaimed contender helps to bring together as well acclaimed contender is the truth love smitten swordmaster while we re on the subject we may as well ride the knight train horse for minute smitten swordmaster is secretly one of the best knight payoffs in the set adventure cards are easy to undervalue as whole because they re so different than what we ve seen before but this is essentially decent drop creature that also has one mana lightning helix or better built in to it reach is always an important thing for aggressive decks to have and being able to adventure smitten swordmaster on turn four or five for ten point life drain and then also play it as creature immediately is quite powerful child of night isn that far below the bar and the adventure potential here is huge it also awesome to bring it back with order of midnight so you can use it again love wintermoor commander while the official knight lord inspiring veteran is most of the good knight cards seem concentrated in wintermoor commander is another powerful knight that is more than the sum of its parts high toughness deathtouch creatures are phenomenal and wintermoor commander makes blocking hell for your opponent in any sort of creature based matchup wintermoor commander is going to be awesome and if your opponent has lot of removal it is going to die just like inspiring veteran would so there not much difference there either knights is looking better and better to take over the mantle from vampires as standard tribal aggro deck of choice hate the great henge want to like this card really do making mana drawing cards gaining life love all of these things but the upfront cost is just too high even with power creature in play this still costs five mana which is going to come down as probably one of the last cards in your hand the great henge has the vanquisher banner problem of just being too expensive and not effecting the board enough to be an engine we re trained by ghalta primal hunger to think this will count the total power of all of our creatures which would be much better but that is not the case also ghalta was perfect last card to play because it was big and game ending curve topper the great henge needs more creatures in hand to make great hope wrong but this one probably best suited for commander love shimmer dragon speaking of commander you may be asking yourself what the hell is shimmer dragon don see this one in the set well you be correct shimmer dragon is not in throne of eldraine proper but rather in the brawl decks that are complementary product to the set however surprise while shimmer dragon is not in booster backs it is fully legal in standard and for all intents and purposes real magic card and you know what shimmer dragon is really powerful there already good precedent for large hexproof fliers being good and shimmer dragon goes beyond that to provide card draw engine too this is all of course contingent on having good number of artifacts in play but if your deck meets the criteria then shimmer dragon is phenomenal top end card shimmer dragon may not make an impact immediately but there is serious potential here if there blue deck interested in playing lot of artifacts love faeburrow elder when evaluating new cards it always important to look at the floor of card as well as the ceiling because what cards fail state is will usually define its playability well palladium myr with vigilance is quite the fail state and faeburrow elder threatens to be quite bit more there no shortage of amazing top end cards to ramp into in standard ranging from six mana planeswalkers to hydroid krasis and friends and faeburrow elder can do some serious damage if you re willing to skew your deck toward it even in three color deck faeburrow elder is going far above and beyond what you normally get for three mana making it very impressive card faeburrow elder with an oath of kaya teferi time raveler or gruul spellbreaker in play is quite the card love fires of invention our last card of the day is perhaps one of the most interesting in lot of ways fires of invention is reminiscent of wilderness reclamation it four mana enchantment that can pay for itself immediately and then give you big mana boost under certain set of restrictions while wilderness reclamation demanded you play instants fires of invention demands big sorcery speed four and five mana cards sound like any midrange decks you know fires of invention is going to pose some pretty interesting deck building questions but as long as you can fuel the fires and have enough things to do with it there huge potential here lot of love think that may have been the highest ever ratio of loves to hates in love hate article that ve done and even the hates we more so based on tempering extreme hype on cards that are playable but not amazing guess that means excited about this set and it good thing to because next week get my first crack at it hark we cordially invite you to watch the mtgeldraine early access streamer event on september pic twitter com qunvxd mi mtg arena mtg_arena september ll be doing my usual ten new standard brews on my stream during the official mtg arena throne of eldraine early access event and then writing about them all in detail next week with grades

it pretty funny now that people were mockingly calling modern horizons commander horizons in an attempt to make fun of wizards of the coast for making modern set with so few playable modern cards in it magic players are notoriously awful at evaluating new cards but even after hogaak arisen necropolis being banned urza lord high artificer crafting an entirely new archetype and wrenn and six completely wrecking legacy there one card whose effect we are going to be feeling for very long time force of negation is one of the most important cards in modern full stop with faithless looting finally banned and graveyard decks no longer putting things into play for free over and over again decks in modern for the most part are actually playing magic again there wide variety of broken things one can do in modern and most them involve casting non creature spells for the ones that want to cast creature spells traditional removal will usually be fine in those spots regardless force of negation puts hard stop to most of the shenanigans that unfair decks can do while also doing so as early as turn one and while allowing you to develop your board it not like we haven seen this before as force of will is the most important card in legacy but force of negation was little hard to use at first because of all the graveyard decks it also wasn entirely clear exactly which decks wanted force of negation but it starting to look like any deck with blue cards in it the most obvious place for force of negation is control decks which have been coming in many varieties azorius control

in modern and it can even tag hate cards like rest in peace we ve been here before soon enough we will realize that force of negation is going to be much closer to force of will than we thought it has many similar features and play patterns while doing lot to help prop up fair decks of all types put simply force of negation must be respected yes it is card disadvantage and you can feel that in fair matchups sometimes but as long as modern is well modern force of negation is going to have serious role however unlike force of will force of negation does have blind spot this means that we can build our decks with force of negation in mind engine cards that are creatures go up in value significantly if your combo piece can be counter by force of negation that great plus card advantage engine creatures like goblin ringleader and tireless tracker also start looking quite nice too whether you plan to beat em or join em if you re going to play modern make sure you understand force of negation role in the new format
it easy to look at decklist that came in st place or made top of major event and think that you ve done your homework for that week event however doing so will only give you small picture of what the format was really like there are often plenty of great decks just end up outside of top that had either slightly worse or even the exact same record as players that made top margins at magic events are very thin and not checking these decks out would be huge leak in your exploration of metagame jacob hagen was on the wrong side of those margins at scg dallas few weeks ago but he had something very interesting brewing jacob took an established but accepted as underpowered archetype black white smallpox and added the format brand new element in stoneforge mystic stoneforge mystic gives the deck an immediate jump in power level and with both batterskull and sword of fire and ice playing so well with what the deck was already doing we ve got something very nice brewing here throw in few copies of the criminally underplayed gideon ally of zendikar and we re off to the races time stamps match match match match match stoneforge pox modern jacob hagen scg dallas th place creatures bloodghast stoneforge mystic planeswalkers gideon ally of zendikar liliana of the veil instants fatal push sorceries thoughtseize inquisition of kozilek lingering souls smallpox artifacts batterskull sword of fire and ice lands plains swamp fetid heath shambling vent godless shrine silent clearing urborg tomb of yawgmoth flagstones of trokair marsh flats sideboard plague engineer ashiok dream render the elderspell kaya orzhov usurper damping sphere collective brutality stony silence fulminator mage damnation buy this deck export text format not too bad despite facing number of matchups that seemed like they be quite difficult on paper we were able to run the tables stoneforge mystic was basically everything the deck could ever want great early threat card that could end the game quickly while our opponents were off balance and card advantage the fear with any disruptive deck is that they ll be able to recover before you can finish them off and stoneforge mystic and gideon ally of zendikar did great job of speeding up the clock speaking of gideon if you re looking for good fair threat that kills fast gideon is an excellent option in modern both stoneforge mystic and gideon pair extremely well with discard spells as you strip away your opponent answers and slow them down then take them out before they can draw what they need when it comes to low resource games gideon and stoneforge are very resource rich if you re looking to play fair in modern or just love smallpox decks give stoneforge pox spin
well whether we agree with it or not faithless looting is no longer part of the modern format so what does that mean for graveyard decks do we throw them all in the garbage what if you already have your dredge deck or your izzet phoenix deck it doesn look like they re going to print careful study anytime soon so where do we turn are there viable replacements for faithless looting in modern well there good news and bad news the bad news is that there really aren great one for one replacements for faithless looting the card was by far the most efficient version of the effect available in the format there was reason it was one of the best cards in the format and why it was banned however don fret there good news too the good news is that with faithless looting gone the graveyard has just become much safer zone to play from without decks like hogaak dredge and izzet phoenix making graveyard removal not only mandatory in sideboards but also sometimes necessary edge in maindecks the graveyard becomes less of an all in proposition this means we don need to be doing something as powerful as hogaak with our graveyard to overcome the trouble of playing around the hate this is because frankly there isn really any hate right now quick look at the results from scg tour dallas last weekend reveals very few graveyard decks and most importantly definitive lack of graveyard hate across most of the top decks from the event so while faithless looting may be gone there far less pressure on your graveyard deck to be amazing because you ll be able to do your thing unimpeded much more often what would you rather play fully powered dredge in world where everyone has four leyline of the void or slightly weaker but still fundamentally powerful dredge deck in world where almost nobody has intense graveyard hate it not about how powerful these decks are in vacuum it about how powerful they are in the current format so let take look at three of the best faithless looting decks from the last year or so and see what we can do dredge perhaps one of the most consistently powerful graveyard decks of the last few years dredge was deck that used every part of the faithless looting buffalo obviously using it to put cards into the graveyard was nice but using the two draws to enable fast dredging once you already had dredge card in the graveyard sped you up considerably and flashback was also super relevant as it allowed you to keep dredging without ever even drawing faithless looting that lot of power and utility to replace however faithless looting isn even the most powerful enabler in dredge while faithless looting was great piece to the puzzle that worked from all angles for cheap cost cathartic reunion is the true powerhouse card in dredge that does literally everything one cathartic reunion and dredge card or two will usually flip almost quarter of your deck in one shot even starting from completely empty graveyard it this amount of speed that gave dredge it most broken openings and we ve still got it the question of course is what do we use to bridge the gap when we don draw cathartic reunion dredge modern jake peralez st place scg dallas modern classic creatures golgari thug bloodghast narcomoeba prized amalgam stinkweed imp sorceries conflagrate cathartic reunion creeping chill life from the loam tome scour artifacts shriekhorn lands

abrupt decay nature claim ancient grudge lightning axe darkblast buy this deck export text format while the main event was devoid of graveyard decks jake peralez would simply swap his faithless looting out for tome scour change few lands and go on to win the sunday modern classic with his slightly modified dredge deck given how little has changed here and how much optimizing there still is to do it not hard to see that dredge is deck that still has legs the problem is that blue sources is not nearly enough to cast tome scour on turn one making it very unreliable would venture that jake won in spite of tome scour his mana base not because of it so alongside tome scour let look at our options there are others but blue offers number of significant mill options that can be turned toward our own library for fun and profit if you were looking to dredge stinkweed imp twice off of faithless looting anyway glimpse the unthinkable does the exact same thing while hedron crab and drowned rusalka provide cheap engines for milling that scale far better into the game than something like shriekhorn these cards have pedigree too dimir dredge extended yuuya watanabe top pro tour austin

alpine moon nature claim lightning axe ancient grudge spell pierce buy this deck export text format we ve maintained the red for cathartic reunion and the green for life from the loam avoiding glimpse the unthinkable for now but it very possible you just want to be dredge is still very powerful and can certainly survive this banning but retooling the deck will be necessary izzet phoenix ah yes izzet phoenix the scourge of modern since my friend and former teammate unleashed arclight phoenix on an unsuspecting modern format this is probably where the faithless looting ban hits hardest as faithless looting was definitely the singular best enabler for arclight phoenix available the deck already wants huge density of one mana cantrips so having cantrip that binned arclight phoenix quickly and easily was large part of what allowed multiple arclight phoenix attacking on turn two or three there are possible replacements but they aren super exciting that basically it seasoned pyromancer doesn jive very well but chart course and izzet charm are both serviceable chart course is much better card to loot with as you maintain card parity while izzet charm flexibility makes it tolerable the reality is that what made izzet phoenix such good deck was not the times it had two arclight phoenix attacking on turn two but the fact that it was really good fair deck that could occasionally do broken things as well thing in the ice and aria of flame are both still awesome magic cards providing very unique and powerful effects for the low cost of playing lot of cantrips in your deck something you re more than happy to do anyway with both cards operating at almost full capacity despite the faithless looting ban we ve still got lot of deck here furthermore while arclight

with lightning axe also helping out to get arclight phoenix into the graveyard for value but there still some serious things happening here that need to be respected mardu pyromancer of course faithless looting had its effect on the fair decks too faithless looting was the backbone of mardu pyromancer giving the non blue deck the ability to manipulate its draw steps while also gaining value of graveyard effects losing that hurts but modern horizons brought some goodies for mardu pyromancer as well to help fill the void seasoned pyromancer steps right in as great graveyard value card that falls perfectly in line with mardu pyromancer gameplan you have plenty of spells you want in the graveyard anyway so seasoned pyromancer does great job of filling the faithless looting role of doing that finding the right cards and making sure you don flood however the card secretly very excited about is ransack the lab yes this is just colorshifted strategic planning card that does not see play in modern but that because blue has an embarrassment of riches in the cantrip department red and black do not ransack the lab can help us find the cards we want provide fuel for bedlam reveler and dump cards like lingering souls and smiting helix in the graveyard as well yes two mana is more than one but mardu pyromancer isn exactly deck known for being fast and our large amount of mana

faithless looting is gone however in weird way this opens up the format to lot of possible graveyard shenanigans don be afraid to experiment as this is very different format than it was few weeks ago we are going to need to realign our perceptions of the format so don be afraid to slay some sacred cows and push those unexpected buttons good luck
near the end of standard format it can be tough to innovate and come up with new decks most cards have been explored and frankly with new set just around the corner acquiring new cards to try things out can be chore so why not look to put sweet twist onto an existing archetype perhaps can interest you in one sided armageddon ashiok dream render is already reasonable card in standard as the anti shuffle clause has good utility against scapeshift decks and the graveyard hate clause works wonders against the four color kethis combo deck from last week and few other places but we re thinking bigger ll just lay it out for you if you play fall of the thran with an ashiok in play you can exile all of the lands in your opponent graveyard making fall of the thran one sided armageddon nice field of the dead time stamps match match match match match ashiok geddon core set standard jim davis planeswalkers jace wielder of mysteries ashiok dream render narset parter of veils teferi hero of dominaria teferi time raveler instants cast down disfigure sorceries the elderspell legion end kaya wrath thought erasure enchantments fall of the thran oath of kaya lands plains swamp drowned catacomb glacial fortress godless shrine hallowed fountain isolated chapel watery grave sideboard disfigure duress noxious grasp the elderspell dovin veto ashiok dream render thief of sanity basilica bell haunt kaya wrath enter the god eternals buy this deck export text format export arena format hah well that embarrassing damn you field of the dead decks grafting the ashiok fall of the thran package onto esper control helps to give it an answer to field of the dead and other decks that try to go over the top with it while also removing any need for creatures to win the game thus blanking your opponent removal while ashiok and fall of the thran don perform well against more aggressive decks you re already very well situated there and as we saw they are going to have dead creature removal as well if you re control player looking for different take on esper control or just an evil person who loves destroying their opponent lands give ashiok geddon spin follow jim davis on twitter and twitch https twitter com jimdavismtg https www twitch tv jimdavismtg
finally it the day we ve all been waiting for since modern horizons we have lived in the shadow of hogaak arisen necropolis which managed to sneakily dodge ban cycle by fooling everyone into thinking bridge from below was the real problem and not the new card with the old mechanic that already has multiple cards on the modern ban list thankfully we no longer have to live with that mistake sorry hogaak don let the door hit you on the way out okay great we can finally start thinking about hogaak less modern my record at the mythic championship with goblins was certainly tainted by record against hogaak maybe we can start there how does saheeli combo sound can we start playing fair decks again so many questions so let get started on figuring sorry what oh no you didn well the truth is they did wizards of the coast has finally pulled the trigger and banned faithless looting in modern yes faithless looting has been one of the most played cards in the format in the last few years some have called it modern brainstorm likening it to one of the key features of the legacy format which is that basically every deck plays brainstorm it at the point in legacy now where everyone just accepts that brainstorm is the most played card and nobody wants to do anything about it because it brainstorm format the problem is faithless looting isn like brainstorm faithless looting like the other hot button modern enabler ancient stirrings isn very good by itself you can just add faithless looting to any modern deck that can cast it and automatically make it better and more consistent putting faithless looting or ancient stirrings into your deck means your deck cares about something maybe you want to discard lingering souls for value or try to set up goryo vengeance into griselbrand or start dredging life from the loam or put hollow one into play quickly whatever it is that you re doing with faithless looting you ve got pretty clearly defined deck building purpose all brainstorm asks is that you play fetchlands basically required mana base in most legacy decks anyway cards like brainstorm or to use more modern analogous cards ponder or preordain tend to stifle deck building and have homogenizing effect on the format when every fair deck has to start with four copies of ponder and four copies of preordain there less room for other cards that actually do things you find the proper removal spells and tarmogoyf you need in very even and consistent distribution and go about doing roughly the same thing every game while playing cards that are individually the best at their respective points on the curve you have very little incentive to play any cards that require work to be good because all your work is done for you cards like faithless looting and ancient stirrings require work just look at some of the cards that are not only playable but have been downright format staples in the last few years because of faithless looting and ancient stirrings that awesome yes sometimes things go bit too far it can be frustrating to be on the receiving end of two arclight phoenix attacking you on turn two or stinkweed imp dredge that hits three creeping chill the turn before you re going to kill your opponent or another turn three karn liberated however before any of these decks got taken to the limit and received one too many good pieces that put them way over the top they were really sweet brews that any magic player would look at and go wow that really cool piece of deck building don take away the powerful and interesting deck building tool take away the cards that actually cause the problems while faithless looting may have gotten those arclight phoenix in the graveyard it was manamorphose ease of allowing you to cast three spells on turn two that brought them back ahead of schedule sure maybe you could race dredge but not when they start the game with an point life swing in their favor sorry why can vintage decks only play one mox sapphire but modern decks can play four all of these things are just happening turn too fast furthermore if you were to ban card like manamorphose or creeping chill you directly target the card that is causing the problem by supercharging deck faster than it should be and more importantly only damaging that deck the only decks that play manamorphose are arclight phoenix decks and old storm decks and neither deck is using the card reasonably creeping chill is only played in dredge surgically remove the problem don just drop the hammer on whole swath of decks that were never even involved in the dirty things that faithless looting was doing and yes understand the argument that leaving faithless looting in the format leaves the door open for more problems as more graveyard cards are printed there are two solutions to that don print cards like creeping chill which do almost nothing in any format except make dredge obnoxious if something does slip through the cracks which will inevitably happen cough cough hogaak then deal with it on case by case basis banning cards happens in modern and while it not pretty it also rarely entirely unexpected or surprising free cards that do things ahead of schedule are more damaging to the modern format than good synergy based mana enablers wait we re not done yet really now stoneforge mystic finally being freed isn necessarily bad thing while there are certainly concerns with homogenization when it comes to what threats fair decks are going to play stoneforge mystic doesn seem out of line in fairly wild modern format both jace the mind sculptor and bloodbraid elf once sheer terrors of the format came off the ban list with relative ease despite significant fear from the community helping to prove how hard playing fair in modern can really be stoneforge mystic helps to tip the scale of modern back toward fair decks giving them yet another excellent tool in their war against modern many varied linear strategies modern horizons hogaak notwithstanding seemed to have this make fair decks better end goal in mind and stoneforge mystic certainly follows that goal coupled with new tools like force of negation stoneforge mystic could have real and positive effect on the format all for letting her lose and seeing where things end up in the absolute worst case scenario if she has to be rebanned so be it but that fairly unlikely the big question is why now when you run any sort of experiment the more variables you introduce at once the harder it is to get accurate results you can gauge the impact of any one variable because it gets blended in with the impact from the other variables making it hard to draw solid conclusions banning hogaak was already big deal but removing faithless looting from modern is one of the biggest upheavals the format has ever seen not to mention that modern horizons the single most impactful set to the modern format ever released really hasn gotten its fair shake yet because of the shadow of hogaak that lot of variables already brewing it seems more prudent to let the dust settle see where things end up and then consider reintroducing huge element like stoneforge mystic at period where things feel relatively stable is that less exciting well yes but pretty sure we ve had enough excitement for one day what would have done this is what would have liked to have seen yesterday announcement date august modern hogaak arisen necropolis banned manamorphose is banned creeping chill is banned mox opal is on the watch list stoneforge mystic is on the unban watch list there no doubt that hogaak arisen necropolis should have been banned but don like dropping huge bomb on the format as well cut out the problem cards keep an eye on other problems and look for good stable spots to consider adding to the format rather than subtracting from it also love the idea of tangible watch list both to let us know what wizards of the coast is thinking internally about certain problem cards as well as giving everyone some advance warning that their entire modern deck runs the risk of being defunct soon modern is long term format players buy into modern because they know they can feel comfortable learning and playing deck for long time to come in perhaps magic most popular format it is certainly format that needs to be kept in check because it can get pretty wild but it not format that takes well to massive sweeping change banning faithless looting in modern was mistake
it unusual when brand new standard deck pops up later in standard season it unlikely when that deck goes on to dominate an event however that exactly what happened recently in the mtg arena mcq the crew of ondrej strasky ivan floch and stanislav cifka have been tearing it up in standard lately with powerful and successful brews and quite frankly they ve done it again ve done some brewing with kethis the hidden hand on stream but had been viewing it as beefy eternal witness variant that wanted you to play with lots of legends but where saw eternal witness ondrej and friends saw yawgmoth will also known as one of the most powerful combo cards of all time the result surprisingly powerful combo deck time stamps match match match match kethis combo ondrej strasky mtg arena mcq creatures diligent excavator fblthp the lost kethis the hidden hand lazav the multifarious planeswalkers ashiok dream render tamiyo collector of tales teferi time raveler sorceries urza ruinous blast enchantments oath of kaya artifacts mox amber lands drowned catacomb godless shrine temple of mystery temple garden glacial fortress hallowed fountain temple of malady temple of silence breeding pool watery grave sideboard teshar ancestor apostle tamiyo collector of tales unmoored ego jace wielder of mysteries urza ruinous blast cerulean drake the elderspell tolsimir friend to wolves ashiok dream render legion end the immortal sun buy this deck export text format export arena format mix together some odd draft commons one card engine and some of the best cards in standard and what do you get kethis combo that what as you saw in the games the true power of this deck comes from the much maligned mox amber the ability to generate free diligent excavator triggers as well as free mana as you loop through every mox amber in your graveyard via the legend rule give the deck it combo potential in conjunction with the activated ability on kethis the hidden hand once you ve gotten through most of your deck it time to point your diligent excavator triggers at your opponent and finish them off as you also saw in the games this deck is tough to play this is not combo deck like scapeshift or show and tell where you play your card and do your thing and win there large amount of setup and finesse and then once you re actually there there bunch of busy work and going off to execute as well in lot of ways the deck resembles the old four color rally the ancestors decks or even modern ironworks decks however if you can get over the learning curve we re looking at and extremely powerful deck in standard right now when your combo deck gets to play the best card in the format teferi time raveler you know you re in good place just beware the rope
one of the great things about magic is how infinitely customizable it is with so many different and varied game pieces and such long history it almost as if there are many different games residing inside the overall scope of magic as whole playing vintage dredge against vintage shops is going to look like completely different game than playing core set draft much like playing six player commander game is going to look vastly different than standard esper control mirror it this amount of fluidity that brings us back over and over again and is why magic has been going for quarter of century with no signs of slowing down there just such huge sandbox to play in that it never feels like you reach the sides formats themselves constantly change but if you ever grow tired of one there always something else to try of course this brings problems as well the reason we have few big main formats think standard modern commander is that there needs to be some sort of uniformity in rule sets or else finding an opponent who wants to play the same game as you can be difficult you may love playing canadian highlander with your roommate at home but if you bring that canadian highlander deck to local store it pretty unlikely you are going to find anyone who also has canadian highlander deck to battle you with there are only so many players in each local store event meaning it can be hard to get two players who want to play semi obscure format in the same place at the same time this is where digital magic vastly outpaces tabletop magic sure on average prefer to play magic in tabletop than digital because like going places and interacting with people but the ease and logistics of digital magic allow for so much more with far less planning instead of only having the people in your immediate area available at times that are convenient to them you ve got every single magic player in the whole world who currently online to draw from now all you need to do is set up an interesting format for them to play and give them some incentive to play it and you re off to the races magic online chaos draft for the uninitiated chaos draft is wild and crazy format that also happens to be one of my favorites chaos draft is fairly simple in practice assemble eight or six players as you normally would for booster draft and proceed as normal the only difference is that you will not be drafting the most recent set but rather from random pool of booster packs from all different sets over magic history typically the ideal chaos draft has no repeating packs meaning every pack you see will be from different set you could end up with three starting packs of future sight onslaught and iconic masters or any other awesome mixture the problem with chaos draft is that logistically getting together chaos draft in paper is quite difficult not only do you need seven other players who want to chaos draft all in the same place at the same time but old packs are expensive booster pack of urza saga is going to run you cool here on coolstuffinc com and even more recent sets like innistrad are going to run you this makes getting an exciting spread of sets both difficult and expensive which really hampers the fun of chaos draft it feels awesome getting to open that old invasion pack and feel like you re touching magic history rather than just feeling like you re opening last year standard packs having chaos drafts on an online platform completely circumvents this issue as well as the issue of needing to get people together to actually do the draft thankfully magic online does just that bringing the chaos draft experience to us at various times as break from cube drafting this is awesome these sorts of fun formats are much easier to do on magic online and for years ve been calling for more things like this one of the biggest failings of online magic early on was that it tried to just exactly mimic paper magic rather than looking at unique things it could do and it great to see this both on magic online and mtg arena which we will get to shortly my only complaint is the current pool of packs available for magic online chaos drafts which has been curated to skip some early sets as well as remove all core sets and masters sets aside from the fact that think all sets should be available for history sake masters set high power level and synergies and core set great collection of baseline effects make putting together good chaos draft decks easier and more fun and who doesn love opening good masters pack would love to see this changed quick word on chaos draft strategy chaos draft is about thinking on your feet and trying to piece together synergy from across many different sets and themes because this isn easy to do you want to focus more on power than all out synergy while still finding nice little pockets of synergy to exploit make sure to try and have good top end and try to stay open and two colors while drafting unless there is very good fixing the format is definitely slower than normal draft so don be afraid to take the draw if you ve got lot of removal and or your opponent deck is slow good luck and enjoy mtg arena standard shakeup while ve lamented for years about the lack of crazy short term formats for magic online mtg arena has not made the same mistakes we ve seen all sorts of crazy game modes that usually last for weekend giving us the chance to explore something new with everyone else for short period of time the most recent was the standard shakeup something they ve done before and expect they will do more often as it is great fun the theme is simple what would happen if all the top cards in standard were suddenly banned as players get tired of playing against teferi time raveler and the standard metagame becomes more and more developed players are always looking for that great week one wild wild west format and this mode gives it to them of course if this was actually what standard looked like going forward it would be eventually solved as the new top cards would take their places in the top tier of the new format but by running it for only short time we get to have our fun and then move on that the best part of these fun short lived formats if somebody breaks it that awesome the format gets broken and is then gone in few days anyway no harm done it hard for me to properly emphasize how important things like this are for the health of digital magic as whole put simply alternate game modes like this are very fun much of the fun and challenge of magic is deck building and exploration which can feel stifled at times by the heavily competitive formats and the ranked ladder there infinite content and strategy available for any given normal standard format meaning that players can brute force their way into learning top deck and do well having these sorts of think on your feet formats really get the creative magic juices flowing can only hope we see more of these events though wish they would last little bit longer to ensure everyone gets chance to play with mtg arena first big rotation coming up we are going to have mtg arena cards not in standard for the first time on our accounts which opens the door up for even more format possibilities things like chaos draft could be great way to get older cards into newer players hands as well as formats that use cards both old and new ve been advocating for build your own standard on magic online for almost decade format where you get to choose few different sets to build your standard deck from and go from there and hopefully we get there one day on mtg arena if you haven tried any of these more out there game modes on mtg arena highly suggest it they encourage creativity are ton of fun and are frankly breath of fresh air when things get little stale like right now with pre rotation standard and pre hogaak ban modern the only downside when it comes to these events on mtg arena is that people don necessarily want to blow all of their wild cards on cards for an event that only last for few days which understand maybe wizards of the coast can make these events phantom or allow you to uncraft any card you crafted for the event itself at the end of it there so much that can be done with digital magic and hope wizards of the coast keeps being unafraid to push the envelope don fight the future digital magic is huge part of the future of magic would never want it to replace tabletop magic as there nothing better than being in room with other players and throwing down with something big on the line but digital magic has so many advantages over paper that they must be properly utilized digital magic is different medium than paper magic and these sorts of fun formats and events help to explore that medium in new and exciting ways let keep it up wizards of the coast
as we approach the end of standard format we re usually looking for two things is there anything fun and competitive not already doing well if there is will that deck survive rotation and for the answer to that question let me introduce you to my friend chandra and her friend chandra and her friend chandra too oh boy this is quite the paradox time stamps match match match match match chandra tribal core set standard jim davis planeswalkers karn scion of urza ugin the ineffable chandra awakened inferno tibalt rakish instigator chandra fire artisan saheeli sublime artificer chandra acolyte of flame sarkhan the masterless instants flame sweep chandra triumph shock sorceries jaya immolating inferno lava coil artifacts mox amber chandra regulator lands mountain interplanar beacon mobilized district sideboard alpine moon dire fleet daredevil lava coil unchained berserker goblin chainwhirler legion warboss buy this deck export text format export arena format who needs other colors when you have more chandras there such great density of planeswalkers in red that other colors aren even needed and with red excellent removal we form the core of very good superfriends style deck with mana base that is smooth as butter and that almost completely avoids rotation while the deck is called chandra tribal the real star of the show is sarkhan the masterless most planeswalker decks have the problem of grinding well but not winning very quickly this means that decks with huge endgames can go over the top of what they are doing not so with sarkhan who is able to take your opponent from to dead in two short turns already great card sarkhan is phenomenal when put in deck with total planeswalkers you also get to utilize chandra triumph which is very underrated removal spell in standard right now if you have chandra in your deck as it almost lightning strike on the floor but turns into pseudo bedevil if you do have chandra that an amazing deal for two mana in only one color the only real disappointment from the deck was chandra regulator which just doesn perform very well unless the game goes super late or we already have chandra in play we need most of our cards and if we mulligan or get thought erasure there just isn enough cardboard to go around to start looting in the midgame would replace at least one regulator with the fourth copy of chandra fire artisan and consider cutting the other as well all and all chandra tribal is blast the deck is fun competitive nice mixup before rotation and most importantly deck that is safe to pick up or craft because almost all of it remains playable post rotation furthermore once nexus of fate and scapeshift two endgames that go way over the top of planeswalkers rotate and the format powers down as whole the deck looks ever better let light it up

ashburn va owner dan snyder and president bruce allen summoned coach jay gruden to the washington redskins facility before dawn monday to tell him he was being fired it was brief conversation allen said now comes longer conversation about the status of the floundering franchise that has won just two playoff games in snyder two decades of ownership and zero during allen tenure gruden is out after an start to his sixth season and is the latest in long line of redskins coaches to take the fall for significant organizational shortcomings to make decision like this is difficult but it was necessary allen said during minute news conference our start is not just disappointing we had much different expectations for the beginning of the season we owe it to our fans the organization the players the coaches and their families to do everything we can to win the redskins haven won much lately going overall under gruden with one playoff appearance in the season popular coach among players and smart offensive mind gruden struggled in preparing his teams washington went in season openers and lost win and get in game in week in against the new york giants who had nothing to play for despite never before being head coach in the nfl and despite never winning more than nine games in season gruden managed to stick around longer than anyone else who held that job during snyder unsuccessful stint as owner asked why snyder wasn addressing fans allen said because am snyder was not made available to reporters monday none of the six coaches hired since snyder bought the team has winning record including hall of famer joe gibbs and two time super bowl champion mike shanahan offensive line coach bill callahan becomes the seventh after he was selected to replace gruden on an interim basis callahan has coached the raiders in the nfl and nebraska in college football this is different territory for me callahan said it bittersweet in lot of ways had to replace veteran coach in jay and then to be asked to lead program now in week it uncharted waters for me this season alone has seen star left tackle trent williams hold out shuffle at quarterback after dwayne haskins was taken no overall in the draft series of injuries up and down the roster and perhaps most upsetting to team leadership increasingly large contingents of visiting fans attending games at washington home stadium all we can do is try to improve our product allen said these games we weren close in we ve lost five games and we didn lose them in the last second we lost these games decisively and we have to change that allen is right the redskins rarely have even been competitive ranking th out of nfl clubs in scoring averaging points and defense allowing points per game the only club that ranks worse than washington in both categories the miami dolphins will host the redskins next sunday cornerback quinton dunbar wrote on instagram that he owes gruden for life for helping him by switching him from wide receiver after college and added sorry we couldn get the job done for you gruden was fired the morning after loss to the defending champion new england patriots afterward gruden said he didn have concern about his job status with season remaining on his contract nobody told me anything gruden said if my key works on monday keep working instead gruden is gone and allen was asked repeatedly about his own job performance the redskins are with allen working in some capacity since allen said he doesn believe anybody is hiding from their record and took issue with questions about the organizational culture that has been the subject of widespread criticism you know the culture is actually damn good allen said these people care we have very young core of players that we have brought in here who are accustomed to winning if you look at the record of these guys they re accustomed to winning they want to win what working the brutal start to the redskins schedule is over and the even more hapless dolphins are up next what needs help everything on defense needs to be better but callahan said he won make any changes to his coaching staff including defensive coordinator greg manusky stock up adrian peterson better be ready to run callahan expressed desire to commit to the running game so an old school ground game is coming stock down haskins could be inactive as washington third quarterback sunday at miami with callahan saying the ohio state product will get his chance at some point injured tight end jordan reed remains out with concussion donald penn williams replacement at left tackle injured hamstring in the patriots game key number the redskins rushing attempts are the third fewest in the nfl next steps callahan will pick starting quarterback between case keenum and colt mccoy and alter the redskins practice habits more ap nfl https apnews com nfl and https twitter com ap nfl copyright by the associated press this story is from espn com automated news wire wire

the nfl biggest trend so far in is well setting trends in its th season highlighted by all sorts of celebrations and honor what has become the nation most popular sport those trends tend to skew toward the negative side because this is supposed to be an uplifting season it worthwhile to take note of some of the more pleasant developments before examining those that have marred the first five weeks of the schedule for example the success of road teams is positive consider that the packers seahawks ravens and eagles have fallen at home the broncos are with mile high migraine in denver those are difficult places to play yet away teams are not counting sunday game in london allegedly home match for the raiders the chiefs patriots and bills already are as road teams as bill parcells frequently said while still coaching if you go on the road you should make the playoffs this trend actually might have begun last january when both conference title games were won albeit laden with controversy by the visitors the rams at new orleans the patriots at kansas city watching some high profile clubs and their stars soar early on is an upbeat trend so are the comebacks into the spotlight of teddy bridgewater watt and robert quinn but it far too easy to get inundated by the bad vibes created by damaging or unconstructive occurrences it can be argued that still the most mentioned name in pro football is someone out of the nfl antonio brown not only did the star wide receiver embarrass himself in three cities by forcing his way out of pittsburgh and oakland then getting cut by new england franchise that takes chance on virtually everyone brown also joined the parade of standout players set in motion by odell beckham jr of players poisoning their relationships with team to force trade elsewhere jadeveon clowney got his transfer out of houston jalen ramsey is playing that disturbing game now with the jaguars also disturbing is seeing so many empty seats in places such as washington cincinnati and all three florida nfl stadiums it only early october and using weather as an excuse is lame and inaccurate try mediocre of worse teams including one in miami that might not beat the nearby hurricanes as the cause maybe one of the things turning off those fans and this is valid is the proliferation of yellow flags so few games have any flow because of all the penalties and it dangerous development an emphasis on penalizing holding early in september so disrupted games that it made baseball seem fast paced in comparison that emphasis appears to have dissipated though there still are plenty of officials flags flying for that violation blaming the lack of on field work for regulars in the preseason was acceptable for few weeks but no longer and what about the perception that on field officials and the officiating office in new york won overturn an interference call on replay review when coach makes challenge as he is now allowed to do under trial rule adjustment resulting from the egregious non call in the nfc title game does the league or at the least those officials with whistles actually despise the rule so much that because interference is judgment call they simply won allow challenge to succeed perhaps the most worrisome trend in has been the epidemic of injuries to starting quarterbacks while some previous no qbs have been benched for poor performances consider that drew brees and ben roethlisberger likely hall of famers are on the sideline so are nick foles cam newton case keenum mitchell trubisky and sam darnold who should return from mononucleosis sometime this month on sunday roethlisberger backup mason rudolph took terrifying hit that knocked him out cold and caused concussion the jets also are down to their third stringer after trevor siemian went down in week with severe ankle injury not to leave bad taste in fans mouths about the nfl whose ratings are up amount of money gambled remains stratospheric and whose fantasy football attractiveness is through the roof consider that there tremendous battle for the no overall pick in next april draft folks of the bengals dolphins jets and redskins are considering any win in that race tantamount to elimination from it more ap nfl https apnews com nfl and https twitter com ap nfl copyright by the associated press this story is from espn com automated news wire wire index recommend tweet email subscribe print comments
