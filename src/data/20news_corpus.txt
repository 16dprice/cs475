from cpage two step seas upenn edu carter page subject re reason vs revelation organization university of pennsylvania lines in article apr athos rutgers edu trajan stephen mcintyre writes in article apr athos rutgers edu writes can only reply with what it says in timothy not here to discount parts of the bible rather here only to discount the notion of revelation the author of timothy told what he thought was the truth based on his belief in god his faith in jesus as the resurrected son and his readings of the old testament but again what had been revealed to him was based on at best second hand information given by friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth or who may have exaggerated bit first of all the original poster misquoted the reference is from tim the author was paul and his revelations were anything but at best second hand and is came about that as saul journeyed he was approaching damascus and suddenly light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground and heard voice saying to him saul saul why are you persecuting me and he said who art thou lord and he said am jesus whom you are persecuting acts nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus pretty cool eh he became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth now you may say the holy spirit revealed these things unto him and we could go into that argument but you be hard pressed to convince me that the holy spirit exists agree don believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists please don complain about this being circular know it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible additionally what he has written is again second hand info if it were given by the spirit and still carries the chance it is not true the spirit is part of god how much closer to the source can you get the greek in timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by god literally means god breathed in other words god spoke the actual words into the scriptures many theologians and bible scholars dr james boice is one that can remember off hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of inspired by god the only way you would be able to escape this notion of second hand info is to have had the entire bible written by god himself and to tell the truth ve studied the bible extensively and have yet to hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing god as the first author of this collection of books that what the verse taken from timothy was all about the continuity of book written over span of years by more than authors from all walks of life is testimony to the single authorship of god and as for reason read what it says in corinthians about human wisdom basically it says that human wisdom is useless when compared with what god has written for our learning if you knew of jesus as well as you know the bible you realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the bible certainly not josephus writings or the writings of the gnostics which were third century at the earliest and though some claim jesus was he was human with all of the human wisdom the apostle paul set out to criticize yet would you not embrace the idea that jesus was wise jesus was fully god as well that why assert that he is wise realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible this is unfortunate to say the least because there is no other way of learning about god and christ and god purpose with the earth than reading the bible and searching out its truth for yourself for your information was raised without any knowledge of god by the time some of the faithful came to show me the word and share with me its truth was living happily and morally without acknowledging the existence of supreme being have though read the bible several times over in its entirety and have studied it thoroughly it contains truth in it and consider jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to have lived in fact darn near idolize the guy but there no rational reason for me to except god existence please rethink this last paragraph if there is no god which seems to be your current belief then jesus was either liar or complete nut because not only did he assert that god exists but he claimed to be god himself regards to lewis how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus in conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out about your reading of the bible not only does the spirit inspire the writers but he guides the reader as well we cannot understand it in the least without the spirit guidance for to us god revealed them through the spirit for the spirit searches all things even the depths of god cor nas peace and may god guide us in wisdom carter page of happiness the crown and chiefest part is wisdom carpenter apprentice and to hold god in awe this is the law that cpage seas upenn edu seeing the stricken heart of pride brought down we learn when we are old adapted from sophocles other theologians get quite annoyed at the misleadingess of god breathed it true that the greek word has as its roots god and breath however etymology doesn necessarily tell you what word means otherwise goodbye would be religious expression since it comes from god be with ye you have to look at how the word was actually used in this case the word is used for wisdom or dreams that come from god but god breathed is an overtranslation clh

from jasons atlastele com jason smith subject re atheist views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart organization atlas telecom inc lines in article apr athos rutgers edu kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko writes jason smith jasons atlastele com wrote the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman mind there must be causal event no reasonable alternative exists would argue that causality is actually property of spacetime causes precede their effects and must concede here cause before effect implies time time is part of spacetime hense the argument would be valid could return and say that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being unique to this spacetime but won because the point is moot doesn address why which petri pikho addresses below also concede that was doubly remiss as asserted no reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist also understand that proving theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes likely description of the phenomena in question am mistaken with this understanding but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith the fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive with out conclusive evidence we are left with faith it could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven as best as non repeatable event can be proven but ask what holds someone today to the belief that any or all of them are correct except by faith couple of paragraphs deleted summary we ask why does the universe exist think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question however is it meaningful question after all would say it isn consider the following apparently it is for many persons hence we have religions the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don exist don exist tautology at its best carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first asks why while the second is request for definition it doesn address why something does or does not exist but asks to define the lack of existence the second question is unanswerable indeed for how do we identify something as nothing aren they mutually exclusive terms how do we identify state of non existence again this is nearing the limits of this simple layman ability to comprehend and would appreciate an explanation might add the worldview of things that exist do and things that don don is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist belief in god it is based on the assumption that there is not reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being reason its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is reason we come to this either am therefore am or am for reason if the former is satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not doctor if the latter your search is just beginning seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question time will tell some christians have talked to have said that actually god is himself the existence however see several problems with this answer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually existence good and evil devils and angels us and them this is pantheism not christianity agreed it would lead me to question their definition of christianity as well another answer is that god is the of all existence this sounds much better but am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this does not preclude his existence it only seeks to identify his qualities implying he exists to have qualities btw the best answer have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions being an atheist myself do not accept such answers since do not have any other methods like the theist we come to statement of faith for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive note am not arguing against scientific endeavor for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist but differ from the atheist in matter of perspective seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the creator also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why it appears that pihko agrees as we shall see but because tool is inadequate to answer question does not preclude the question asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer as far as can tell the very laws of nature demand why that isn true of something outside of nature super natural this is not true science is collection of models telling us how not why something happens cannot see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist my apologies was using why as why did this come to be why did pre existence become existence why did pre spacetime become spacetime but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why because it can be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid don believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinion this opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow different from inanimate systems do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in lab suppose we would do the same thing as when galileo or capernicus was vindicated before someone starts jumping up and down screaming inquisition note said vindicated certainly hope we ve gotten beyond the shooting the messenger stage pihko does present good point though we may need to ask what do as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if new discovery truly disagrees with what god said and continues to say in his word why do ask why apologies to budweiser and company jason jason smith jasons atlastele com not young enough to know everything
from aa freenet carleton ca mark baker subject re the arrogance of christians reply to aa freenet carleton ca mark baker organization the national capital freenet lines to what follows our moderator has already answered the charge of arrogance more ably that could have done so so will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic in previous article eugene bigelow ebay sun com geno says if don think my belief is right and everyone else belief is wrong then don have belief this is simply what belief means unfortunatly this seems to be how christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion this is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is or was taught to think it is the fundamental premis is not not if thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible we should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word believe however the weak sense means am not sure believe tom went to the library but he could have gone to the track the strong sense means am so certain that use it as basis of thought believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws despite the fact that nature appears capricious and unpredictable christian belief is of the strong kind though christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the only one and if you don accept their teachings then you won be saved note that these are two separate ideas most hold the first view but the majority do not hold the second is is again matter of pure logic that if christanity is true then hinduism for example must necessarilly be false insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with christaianity and as matter of logic vice versa it takes quite bit of arrogance to claim to know what god thinks wants it is arrogant to claim to know what anyone thinks or wants unless they have told you christians believe god has told us what he thinks and wants especially when it based upon your interpretation of book most christians do not base their belief on the bible but on the living tradition of the church established by christ and guided constantly by the holy spirit the bible is simply the written core of that tradition the logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can both be correct if depends what you mean by differing if believe tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs pounds our beliefs differ but we may both be right if believe tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine one of us at least must be wrong it all about perception no two people are exactly alike no two people perceive everything in the same way believe that there is one truth call it god truth universal truth or call it what you will don believe god presents this truth think it is just there and it up to you to look for and see it through prayer meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever just because people may perceive this truth differently it doesn mean one is wrong and the other is right thus you believe that there is single truth but that no human being can find it you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken in short you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong qed as an example take the question is the glass half empty or half full you can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct so for your belief to be true does not require everyone else belief to be wrong here begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth but simply with language saying that the glass is half empty is not contradiction of the statement that it is half full it is the same fact expressed in different words the whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the same fact it is of course quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words it is also true that they may fail to understand each other words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart great scisms have occurred in just this way and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief this does not mean in any sense that all beliefs are equally valid since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away some of the beliefs that some people hold must necessarilly be false and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so if believe and you believe we may both be correct but if is equivalent to not then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs we must each regard the other as in error mark baker the task is not to cut down jungles but aa freenet carleton ca to irrigate deserts lewis

from db andrew cmu edu andrew byler subject the nicene creed was re major views of the trinity organization freshman civil engineering carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines michael bushnell writes the so called creed of athanasius however has always been western creed and has always had the filioque the orthodox have said that they accept all that it says with the exception of the filioque but it is not in use which is exactly what pointed out though was wrong about your use of the creed the catholic encylcopedia in which read about it said the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque apparently that has changed the athanasian creed has always had the filioque the nicene did not of course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicene creed it wasn there to begin with but they certainly did from the athanasian creed which did have it from the beginning might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the blessed trinity the east emphasizing the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the father through the son and the west using proceeding from the father and the son in fact some such as tertullian used both formulations see below following therefore the form of these examples profess that do call god and his word the father and and his son two for the root and the stem are two things but conjoined the fountain and the river are two kinds but indivisible the sun and the ray are two forms but coherent ones anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be second to that from which it proceeds but it is not on that account separated from it where there is second however there are two and where ther is third there are three the spirit then is third from god and the son just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem and third from the fountain is the stream from the river and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray tertullian against praxeas about ad and believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father through the son tertullian against praxeas about ad and as st thomas showed in his summa theologica part question articles and there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation and in fact the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what st augustine among others taught that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and the son but he proceeds from the father in more preeminent way for whatever the son has he has from the father certainly he has it from the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him for the father alone is not from another for which reason he alone is called unbegotten not indeed in the scriptures but in the practice of theologians and of those who employ such terms as they are able in matter so great the son however is born of the father and the holy spirit proceeds principally from the father and since the father gives to the son all that he has without any interval of time the holy spirit proceeds jointly from both father and son he would be called son of the father and of the son if which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind they had both begotten him the spirit was not begotten by each however but proceeds from each and both st augustine of hippo the trinity to ad so in sense all of the formulations are correct to the west at least because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son but in proceeding from the son the orgin of that procession is the procession from the father so the holy spirit is proceeding from the father through the son but as all that the son has is from the father the holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father without any mention of the son being necessary in any case am happy to know that follow in the beliefs of pope st leo st fulgence of ruspe st cyril of alexandria pope st damsus st augustine of hippo st epiphanius of salamis st ambrose of milan st hilary of poitiers tertullian and others among the fathers who all have very quotable quotes supporting the catholic position which enunciated above as for the issue of the adoption of another creed being forbidden will point out that the holy fathers of ephesus and chalcedon both spoke of the creed of nicea in their statement forbidding anyone to produce write or compose confession of faith other than the one defined by the fathers of nicea that creed is different creed than that of constantinople which is commonly called the nicene creed not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the creed which is but an enlargement upon the creed of nicea but that they were condemning the impious opinions of nestorious who had adopted radically different creed from the one used by the church which among other things denied the procession of the holy spirit form the son thus the additions of the creed were not thought to be in violation of this and as the council chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the holy spirit from the son which nestorius denied they could hardly have been against explaining in fuller way the creed for they themselves approved of previous additions to it and if the further explanations of the creed made in constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the holy fathers of nicea or in any way heretical it follows that the council of toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the creed so as to combat the impieties of the arians in spain because the filioque was not in dispute in the church until many years later under photius and others and that the filioque was not disputed provide more quotes below since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to god and he actually proceeds from the father and son it is abundantly clear that he is of the divine essence in it in essence and proceeding from it st cyril of alexandria the treasury of the holy and consubstantial trinity thesis ad the holy spirit is not of the father only or of the son only but he is the spirit of the father and the son for it is written if anyone loves the world the spirit of the father is not in him and again it is written if anyone however does not have the spirit of christ he is none of his when the father and the son are named in this way the holy spirit is understood of whom the son himself says in the gospel that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and that he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you pope st damasus the decree of damasus ad the only begotten holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor the appelation of father but is called holy spirit and is not foreign to the father for the only begotten himself calls him the spirit of the father and says of him the he proceeds from the father and will receive of mine so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to the son but is of their same substance of the same godhead he is spirit divine of god and he is god for he is spirit of god spirit of the father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesis like soul and body in us but in the midst of father and son of the father and of the son third by appelation the father always existed and the son always existed and the spirit breathes from the father and the son and neither is the son created nor is the spirit created st epiphanius of salamis which is on cyprus the man well anchored and ad concerning the holy spirit ought not to remain silent nor yet is it necessary to speak still on account of those who do not know him it is not possible for me to be silent however it is necessary to speak of him who must be acknowledged who is from the father and the son his sources st hilary of poitiers the trintiy to ad thus as have pointed out before gaul spain italy africa egypt palastine and the lands of the greeks all of christnedom at that time all have fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque suggest to those of the orthodox church that they come up with some of the fathers besides st john of damascus who all will admit denied the filioque to support their views it is not enough to bring up the proceeds from the father line of the creed or the gospel of john for that says what we believe also but it does not say the holy spirit does not proceed from the son only that he does proceed from the father andy byler

from pharvey quack kfu com paul harvey subject re sabbath admissions of organization the duck pond public unix log in as guest lines in article apr athos rutgers edu pharvey quack kfu com paul harvey writes priority than the direct word of jesus in matt paul begins romans with if someone is weak in the faith do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith you read jesus word in matt is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin greek hamartia missing the mark is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark however like to be clear that do not think there unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited whereas the ten commandments and jesus words in matt are fairly clear are they not are they clear or do you have doubts no don believe that paul can overrule god an important first step the realization that paul was human however paul was writing for largely gentile audience yes and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best very weak in the faith most could not read most were unfamiliar with the hebrew scriptures in even the septuagint form paul adapted the message of the bible to largely uneducated market granted this market still exists today but do you count yourself as part of it to be weak in the faith is not missing the mark hamartia if you do the best that your education allows are you doing the best the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called noachic laws but they are quite minimal let me make clear that the law is none other than the pentateuch of genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy what did jesus say about the law in matt where did jesus say that the law only applies to jews and that gentiles are above the law the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didn say that the law was abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn apply to gentiles who acknowledged this fact on what basis are we extra biblical at this point why not also acknowledge that the bhagavad gita is the only relevant text for gentiles after all we see in the bible that it was magus from the east who observed the star signs of jesus why bother with any texts at all why not just follow whatever the church has to say thus there is no contradiction with mat don see how you can say this with straight face are you follower of christ or do you follow someone else are you saying that the words of jesus only apply to jews as far as can tell both paul and other jewish christians did continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thus they continued to obey the law how jewish was paul after he changed his name from saul the issue was and is with gentile christians who are not covered by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it who says gentile christians are not covered by the first five books who says that gentile christians are above the ten commandments jesus dealt mostly with jews think we can reasonably assume that mat was directed to jewish audience you re implying that jesus words are valid only for jews is this really what you mean to say you do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the bible when you read jesus words did you ever consider that maybe just maybe jesus is talking to you no matter what your race or sex if the hebrew scriptures and the gospel accounts of jesus are only directed to jews why were they translated into english he did interact with gentiles few times the centurion whose slave was healed and couple of others the terms used to describe the centurion see luke suggest that he was god fearer gentile who followed god but had not adopted the whole jewish law as paul would call him one who was weak in the faith he was commended by jewish elders as worthy person and jesus accepted him as such this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view that gentiles need not accept the law which is more important the recorded word of jesus or indications that you can deduce from the bible was jesus god only of the jews or god of all humankind of all race and sex however there more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law in order to get full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with paul apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least as read paul he says that the law serves purpose that has been in certain sense superceded this is your understanding of paul compare this to the word of jesus are you christian or pauline again this issue isn one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that not what he intends to say rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ again this is your understanding of paul did jesus say that the law was an impossible standard did jesus say that he superceded the law are you christian or pauline paul comments are not the world clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading you acknowledge that it is your reading of paul what did jesus say can you deny that matt is quite clear in its meaning are you christian or pauline but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin it important that it not be relaxed when did jesus say that the purpose of the law was conviction of sin however for christians it not the end ultimately we live in faith not law please reread matt are you christian or pauline jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details are you saying that the ten commandments are ceremonial details paul conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards you call observance of the sabbath the day on which the lord rested ceremonial has circumcision been superceded for christians are you christian or pauline both there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not at least not in this case jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles that why have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the centurion as to general jewish views on this am dependent largely on studies of pauline theology one by schoeps and one whose author can come up with at the moment both authors are jews also various christian and non christian jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups mat is clear that the law is still valid it does not say that it applies to gentiles and yes say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandments is ceremonial detail when you re looking at the obligations of gentiles similarly circumcision not sure quite what else can say on this subject again it unfortunate the jesus didn answer the question directly however we do know what the st cent jewish approach was how jesus dealt with at least one gentile and how jesus disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute referring to acts more than paul given that these are all in agreement don see that there big problem clh

kulikauskas writes deletia no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat find that am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves little in the cosmic sense ah in the sence but who lives in the cosmic sence not me cosmicly we don even exist for all practical purposes can hardly use the cosmic sence of stuff as guide to life it would just say don bother luckily for mortals there are many sences of scale you can talk about in human sence you can have big purposes even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind eventually to be turned into dust but the influence of aristotle confucious alexander ceasar and countless others is still with us although their works have perished but they have changed to course of history and while humanity exists their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing even if they are utterly forgotten mankind itself will one day perish one day surely well unless you believe in the second coming which do not but in that time we can make difference without some that transcends the physical without god it is all pointless in the end in the end but it must be the end until then there is all the point you can muster and when that end comes there will be nobody to ask gee don think james sledd deeds are gonna make much of difference ulitmately ya know but they will have already have made difference great or small before the end why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile most people are able to live with that and for them little purposes success money power effecting change helping others suffice little is in the eye of the beholder of course suppose they never think about the cosmic scale or are at least able to put it out of their minds don doubt it but have thought about the cosmic scale and it does not seem to mean much to us here today to me it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion would not find this comforting but perhaps it is merely my definitions here what think the relevant terms are reality that which is real illusion that which is not real but seems to be real objectively existing for reality to be an illusion would mean then that which is real is not real but seems to be or that which objectively exists does not objectively exist but does seem to objectively exist from which we can conclude that unless you want to get contradiction that no things objectively exist but have problem with this because would like to say that objectively exist if nothing else cogito ergo sum and all that perhaps you do not mean all that but rather mean objective reality is unreachable by humans which is not so bad and so far as know is true that the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit have on if reality is an illusion isn true reality an illusion too and if true reality is spirit doens that make spirit an illusion as well if am not distinctly confused this is getting positively buddhist that this world is school of sorts where we learn and grow and our souls mature that is one hell of statement although perhaps true do you mean to imply that it was intended to be so if so please show that this is true if not please explain how this can give purpose to anything that gives purpose to my little purposes how does it do that wouldn the world school intent idea make the world preparation for some greater purpose rather than purpose in itself and takes some of the pressure off what pressure it not so necessary to make this life success in human terms if you re really just here to learn it is not necessary to be success in human terms unless your goals either include doing so or require doing so before they themselves can be achived indeed many people have set goals for themselves that do not include success in human terms as understand it check out yer buddhist monk type guy out for nirvana which is not at all the same thing it more important to progress grow persist to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love especially when it dificult to do so honest effort is rewarded by god he knows our limitations why is learning to love goal what happens if you fail in this goal to you to god to the mysterious purpose deletia question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was mostly quote two serious questions invitations to discussion what is the nature of eternal life how can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it possible answer for the best we can do is metaphor analogy question what is the best metaphor ll have crack at that the nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name it is the concept of life without death life without end no we can put together word to describe it but we cannot imagine it no metaphor is adequate next to eternity if it were we could not understand it either or so suspect dan johnson and god said jeeze this is dull and it was dull genesis these opinions probably show what know

from cs mcd brunel ac uk michael davis subject re when are two people married in god eyes organization brunel university uxbridge uk lines robert anderson randerso acad sahs uth tmc edu wrote would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged couple become married in god eyes some say that if the two have publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to god and are unswervingly committed to one another realize this is subjective qualifier they are married joined in god sight the way read scripture couple becomes married when they are physically married when they first have sexual intercourse the end of genesis quoted from memory for this reason man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife and they will become one flesh jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage if you read through genesis in particular you will often come across the phraseology man lay with woman and she became his wife this implies that she became his wife when they lay together at the point of intercourse compare this with jewish tradition joseph when he heard that mary was pregnant had it in mind to divorce her quietly but mary and joseph were betrothed not married they were in binding relationship which required divorce to get out of but marriage would not occur until mary and joseph went to bed together compare with christ and the church ephesians revelation the church is described as the bride of christ but the marriage of the lamb takes place when jesus returns we are in binding love relationship with jesus but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and god in summary engagement should be honoured as binding relationship but it is not marriage civil ceremony is not marriage either marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together don mean to demean the civil or church ceremony ours was great don mean to be too pedantic historically think am correct in stating that the civil ceremony marriage recognised by the state has only been around in the west since napoleon who introduced it to keep tabs on the people although ready to be corrected on that point this view obviously raises some questions what about those who have had sex with one or more partners without considering marriage are those people also married if it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state would say yes because this honours the laws of our nations in the west although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most western countries believe that it is god honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage its to do with our being salt and light and also to do with how people will perceive us it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through civil ceremony michael davis cs mcd brunel ac uk and hast thou slain the jabberwock come to my arms my beamish boy

from sun gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo subject re christianity and repeated lives lines in article may athos rutgers edu jek cu nih gov writes gerry palo writes there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of repeated lives on earth the apostle paul romans points out that god chose jacob rather than esau to be the ancestor of the covenant people and ultimately of the messiah and that he made this choice while the two boys were still in their mother womb and therefore could not possibly have done anything good or evil to deserve their appointed destinies if we admit the possibility that they had lived previous lives and that in accordance with the asiatic idea of karma their present lives are reward or punishment for past behaviour this makes nonsense of paul whole point the existence of repeated earth lives and destiny karma does not mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds there is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction but did not subscribe to that view god may choose one individual over another as the fit instrument for his plans but that does not preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in this earthly life is not the result of longer course of development do not and rudolf steiner did not subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable mechanistic karma determining everything that befalls one this is kind of shriveled caricature of much greater law in the context of which the deed of christ on golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as working of christ can be seen as the master theme and indeed new impulse that was completely free of karma christ incarnated only once in the flesh and in that he had no debt of karma or sin the oriental concepts of reincarnation and karma which are even more trivialized and mechanized in some new age teachings incorrectly assume jesus christ to have been the reincarnation of master avatar etc their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the continuing individuality from one life to the next buddhism more important they have no concept of the resurrection of the body the ultimate continuity of the whole human being to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the last day there is another biblical passage that also has bearing it is the tenth chapter of john devoted almost entirely to the man born blind clearly here jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma or that of his parents that led to his blindness but rather that new impulse is to be revealed through him but note that he does not refute the disciples question in fact they ask it as matter of course the question being stated as if it were self evident that only one of two possibilities existed it was either the sins of the man himself obviously not in this incarnation or the sins of his parents the fact that they even asked about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of christ answer indicates that he did not disagree with it there is also matthew where jesus says straight out about john the baptist if you care to accept it he himself is elias who was to come this also emphasizes that the gospels do not have positive teaching either way about reincarnation or in fact about what happens to the human being at all between death and the last day even jesus did not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it if you care to accept it so took care to point out not that the bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either and that much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way pointedly used repeated earth lives to distinguish little from the oriental doctrines usually associated with the word reincarnation the phrase is rudolf steiner wiederholte erdenleben he noted too that the idea needed to arise as new insight in the west completely free from eastern tradition it did in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the most important expression of it being lessing the education of the human race to return to your original point paul statement about jacob and esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma and both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the incarnation death and resurrection ascension and return of jesus christ in my view regards gerry palo compuserve com

from xx yfn ysu edu family magazine sysops subject the empty tomb reply to xx yfn ysu edu family magazine sysops organization st elizabeth hospital youngstown oh lines the empty tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur smith when jesus was on earth he made an amazing prediction about himself and frequently repeated it let me quote it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again matthew wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving reproval knew he would die before he was years of age he knew the very city where he would die he knew that the religious leaders of his own race would condemn him to death he knew that one of his own would betray him he knew that before his actual death took place he would be mocked and scourged he knew exactly how he would die by crucifixion all this is in itself remarkable but more amazing than the minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted would follow shortly after he was buried that he would rise again he even designated the time on the third day but since it is on this central fact the death and resurrec tion of jesus christ that the whole truth or untruth of chris tianity turns let us examine it more closely the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed the body was placed in tomb which had never before been used and great stone was rolled against the entrance the jewish authorities fully aware that jesus had predicted he would rise again had the stone officially sealed and on saturday placed guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body early sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body to their utter astonishment they found the stone rolled away the body gone they rushed back to tell the disciples shortly two of jesus friends peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the tomb empty just as the women had said even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone matthew how did this tomb become empty one of the most famous new testament scholars in america professor of new testament literature in large theological seminary wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty and wrote it in letter not marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the chimney at christmas time but he didn realize that santa clause never did come down any chimney at christmas time because there never was santa claus and there is jesus he died he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body was gone those are facts of history no one can escape the responsi bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old another professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard university tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb the facts are these first so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days even if the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too go to the wrong tomb third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb there is of course record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is com monly reported among the jews until this day matthew this is good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty they never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true they knew it was true another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty the soldiers were told to say that jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep how could they know what was going on while they were asleep obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus first as professor heffern points out the leaders of judaism in jerusalem who had put the lord jesus to death had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty if there had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected then proved second surely one of the disciples even most of them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent it may be possible to live lie but men seldom die for lie and most of these men did the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories it would have lost it power instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to despairing humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever but not only did jesus come alive again he did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to him instead he appeared to them literally visibly frequently he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew later that day to mary magdalene alone john and to simon peter also alone luke in the afternoon he walked with two of his followers toward emmaus luke and that night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at jerusalem mark luke etc week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at the same place john once he was seen by above brethren on mountain in galilee corinthians and finally to the apostles just before his ascension mark luke acts as with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness but these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence none has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president of princeton these men and countless others have believed it but suppose christ did rise from the dead what of it what has it to do with my life what has it to do with your life just this it seals with certitude the teachings of christ jesus taught many great truths especially many about himself he claimed to have come down from god he said he was the way to god he said he was the son of god who alone knew god perfectly he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life and no one else had it he said that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to us thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day he revealed that in these amazing unparalleled predictions he spoke the truth do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that his words are all true the point is does not the truth of the resurrection convince us that he is none other than the one he claimed to be the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that he has broken the power of death and that he will some day raise us also up from the grave as he promised in other words if this person jesus christ the son of god in all this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life for he said life built on him would know forgiveness of sins his compan ionship and help joy that no circumstances can ever take away and hope that shineth more and more unto perfect day those who have tried it down through the ages and there have been many have given their testimony and we today who believe also know

from db andrew cmu edu andrew byler subject esp sirach organization freshman civil engineering carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines dave davis writes let my state my point as provocatively as possible after going through several study bibles leaning heavily towards the assertion that the wisdom of ben sira or ecclesiasticus is directly referenced by in fact think sirach is more directly referenced by james than or is referenced in any nt verse ve seen good point the new testament does not quote ezra nehemiah esther ruth job ecclesiastes or song of songs just as it does not quote from the deuterocanon but if the non quotation of the former does not disqualify them neither does the non quotation of the later and the wisodm of solomon was quite clearly an influence on st paul especially in the letter to the romans cf especially romans and wisdom stuff deleted think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be consistently applied are not very useful as principles so if we are to exclude them not accord them the authority of scripture we would appear to require other reasons what might these reasons be tradition always fav with episcop tradition is equivocal on this subject sirach believe is in vaticanus sinaiticus don know if it is listed in the muratorian canon the oldest list know of sirach and the others are discussed by the fathers as scripture but not unanimously true not all accepted them as scripture though niether were all the books of the new testament so accepted which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted hebrews the apocalypse peter esther and others were debated at various times but eventually retained as for the codexes you mention both vaticanus and sinaitcus include the deuterocanon bothe of the new and old testaments and vaticanus think inlcudes clement the shepard of hermas and the epistle of baranabas as for the muratorian canon it deals with the new testament only though it is very valuable in its witness to those books my interim conclusion is that protestant exclusion of at least one of these writings is one of those traditions of men one hears of so often they were excluded during the reformation and that appears to be the reason many people continue to exclude them any takers can be reasonable if all else fails show me where wrong you re not wrong it is tradition of men to exlcude them as will explain below that nothing be read in the church under the nmae of divine scripture except the canonical scriptures and the canoncial scriptures are genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy joshua judges ruth four books of kingdoms being samuel and kings two books of paralpomenon being chronicles job the psalter of david the five books of solomon being proverbs ecclesiastes song of songs wisdom of solomon and misatributed to him the wisdom of jesus son of sirach the books of the twelve minor prophets isaiah jeremiah being jeremiah the lamentations baruch and the letter all of which were formerly counted as one ezekiel daniel tobit judith esther two books of ezra being ezra and nehemiah two books of maccabees and of the new testament four books of the gospel one book of the acts of the apostles thirteen letters of paul the apostle one letter of the same to the hebrews two of peter the apostle three of john one of the apostle jude one of the apostle james one book of the apocalypse of john council of hippo statute ad this same list was promulgated again at the third council of carthage ad and at the sixth council of carthage ad at which council the same list was enumerated with the words because we have recieved from the fathers that these are the books to be read in the church which ought to quiet those who assert in the name of holy scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the church as the episcopal church does in removing the deuterocanon from the realm of scripture though the episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the church they are not counted as scripture by them and may not be used to prove dogma the lutherans hold out similarly earlier mention of the so called apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found and below inlcude only portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the fathers and this is the reason why the law of the old testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty two books so that they may correspond to the number of letters in the hebrew alphabet it is to be noted also that by adding to these tobias and judith there are twenty four books corresponding to the number of letters used by the greeks st hillary of poitiers commentaries on the psalms prologue ad the twenty two books according to the hebrews are jeremiah with lamentations and the letter reckoned as one and also there is maccabees origen commentaries on the psalms psalm ad divine scripture addressing itself to those who love themselves and to the boastful says most excellently baruch follows st clement of alexandria the instuctor of children ad learned accurately the books of the old testament proverbs of solomon and also wisdom st melito of sardes fragment found in eusebius history of the church and dating from crica ad book it is likewise decreed now indeed we must treat of the divine scriptures what the universal catholic church accepts and what she must shun the list of the old testament wisdom one book ecclesiasticus one book tobit one book judith one book of maccabees two books st damasus pope the decree of damsus section ad would think this enough though more can be shown that the church has always accepted the deutero canon though parts have been disputed by various persons for if disputes involving the new testament deutero canon does not disqulaify those books hebrews james peter john jude revelation in protestant eyes than neither should it disqulaify the old testament books and must point out that the jews only drew up their canon in ad years after the founding of the christian religion upon the cross why should we adhere to canon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the chrsitian use of the greek septuagint which includes the deutero canon as early as ad st justin had already accused the jews of mutilating the canon of scripture by their removal of certain books protestants apparently prefer to think that god revelation was limited by decree of the jews in the ordering of their the jews faithless canon and that he could not use other people like the apostles in drawing up the canon the apostles were most certain users of the septuagint as some of the old testament quotes use the wording of the septuagint and not the hebrew and the septuagint includes the deuterocanon

from jek cu nih gov subject god morality and massacres lines listmember andrew killie think wrote in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god any god who works that way is indescribably evil and unworthy of my worship or faith nobuya higgy higashiyama replied as in substance did others where is your source of moral standards by which you judge god behavior it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge god actions who is the clay to talk back to the potter but we find contrary view in scripture when god proposes to destroy the city of sodom genesis abraham says suppose that there are some good men in the city will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked far be it from you lord to do such thing shall not the judge of all the earth do right am told that the hebrew is actually bit stronger than this and can perhaps be better rendered dynamic equivalence as shame on you lord if you do such thing there are those who say that the definition of good is whatever god happens to want but if that is so then the statement that god is good has no meaning it simply says that god does what he wants that being the case no one can either love or obey god because he is good the only motive left for obeying him is that he is powerful just as it makes sense to obey dictator even when he tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself so it makes sense to obey god because he has the power to punish you if you don this ethical theory take to be in radical contradiction to genesis and to christianity in general any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality or of the goodness of god meaningless however it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve good result when read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in history those actions often seem to me very different from what might expect of god who loves us and desires what is best for us moreover leaving the scriptures aside and considering the natural world find that nature is often very different from what might expect if it were the work of benevolent deity origen said those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in nature now that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence power wisdom and goodness of god on the contrary their absence would be such an argument suppose that am watching bobby fisher play chess and suppose that every time he makes move find myself nodding and saying good move just what was expecting him to do same move would have made if were playing that would be sign that fisher is no better chess player than myself given that he is better expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking now what do suppose induced him to do that or even boy that was real slip he just thrown the game away similarly if god understands the workings of the universe better than do it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if he has made mistake one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the controls of the universe is that can see the end of the chess game if fisher wins revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen moves earlier however if he loses and particularly if can see that there was time when he had an opportunity for checkmate in two moves and did not take it then know that he is not as good player as had thought with god on the other hand shall not in this life see the total result of some of his actions therefore my grounds for judging that have seen bad move on his part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making similar judgement about fisher in the book of genesis we read that joseph ten older brothers who with good reason found him insufferable conspired to sell him into slavery in egypt there he eventually became viceroy and when there was famine in canaan he was able to provide for his family when his brothers nervously apologized he told them do not worry you meant to do me evil but god turned it into good once heard rabbi speak on this text he said the history of the jews is largely history of events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival of the religion or the people or both but amazingly those events turn out to be the saving of the jews and of judaism the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup of the family but in fact it ended with reconciliation of the quarrel between them the famine that drove the family out of canaan looked like misfortune for them but in fact if they had stayed in canaan they would almost certainly have intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into their culture their oppression by the egyptians few generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like disaster but god used it to bring them out of egypt and into the promised land here the people built temple and regularly offered sacrifices but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea destroyed temple and city and countryside and deported most of the people to babylon you might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion but it was not living in canaan the people had been under constant danger of assimilation again and again they had turned from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility cults with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice the babylonian captivity put stop to that never again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the babylonians ever again had foothold among them nor is that all judaism had been in danger of becoming simply system of sacrifices and temple observances the only prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem every so often and offering sacrifice during the captivity with the temple gone the jews invented the synagogue place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the scriptures they came to realize clearly what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea that god is not simply local or tribal deity not just the controller of the land of canaan or the patron of the jewish people but the creator of the world and the ruler and judge of all humans everywhere time passed and the babylonian empire was replaced by that of the persians and then that of the greeks or rather the macedonians the ruler antiochus epiphanes was determined to stamp out judaism and to this end he made the reading and the study of the torah punishable by death again one might think that this would be the end of judaism but it was not the people met for worship and instead of reading the torah portion appointed for the day they would read some passage from the prophets that had similar theme and then discuss that before this time the torah the so called five books of moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy were the only books read and studied in the synagogue if it had not been for antiochus the books of the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether his hatred for judaism saved them other examples here omitted for brevity sake some of you may remember that julie andrews first became famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair lady when warner brothers undertook to make movie of it everyone expected that julie who had been so magnificent on stage would play the same role in the movie instead the studio decided to go with an established screen star and cast audrey hepburn julie andrews was naturally crushed but she later realized that if she had played the screen role she would have been type cast for life as an elize doolittle type it would have been disaster for her as it was walt disney offered her the role of mary poppins and she won an oscar for it at the presentation she stood there smiling and looking at walt disney she said and now my special thanks to the man who made all this possible jack warner it was the most memorable line of the evening in similar spirit we jews might thank the men who in the providence of god have preserved judaism and kept it alive to this day beginning with joseph brothers and continuing with two pharaohs with nebuchadnezzar with antiochus epiphanes after the formal meeting had broken up one woman came up to him privately and said you were talking about the holocaust weren you he answered if that is an example that came to your mind then you are right was talking about it to you but would not talk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear it assume that he meant that without the holocaust there would have been no state of israel someone hearing the rabbi lecture might leap to the conclusion that god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his purposes or at least that the rabbi thought so he might then go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact god doing that he stirred up joseph brothers to murderous hate against him and that when the israelites were in egypt god hardened pharaoh heart so that he oppressed the people and would not let them go and this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has brought about suggest another way of looking at it consider sculptor who has log of wood from which he proposes to carve statue but the log instead of having smooth even grain throughout has large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface the sculptor considers the wood for while and then carves statue that features the knot that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue so that observers will say how fortunate the sculptor was in finding piece of wood with knot like that in just the right place its presence is the crowning touch the thing that makes the statue great work of art in reality the knot far from being what the sculptor was looking for was challenge to his skill if the wood had not contained that flaw he would still have made great work of art but different one so if joseph brothers had not sold him god would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people but he would have done so in another manner if judas had not betrayed jesus if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected jesus but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god if pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set jesus free it might appear that there would have been no crucifixion and therefore no redemption and therefore no salvation not so god did not need judas sin to redeem us if judas had done right then god in christ would still have reconciled the world to himself we do not know how just as we do not know how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like grand central station and just as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked fisher knight instead don bother to look up the game in question am making up this example but the point is none the less valid thus we may say both that god used say the cowardice of pilate to accomplish his purposes and that the said cowardice was not god doing and that pilate would not have thwarted god plans by behaving justly and courageously what then are we to make of the place where god says to moses will harden pharaoh heart so that he will not let the people go some christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was puppet with god pulling the strings and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work but the work of god in him suppose rather that what god was telling moses was something like this if you see that pharaoh is not willing to let the people go do not be discouraged or suppose that the situation is out of my control my purposes will not be thwarted if pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go well and good if he does not will fit his resistance into my plans and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that would have been thrown for loss if pharaoh had obeyed me to return to the question that started this all off is it possible that the serbs in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia are instruments of god will first point what they are doing is wrong just as what joseph brothers did was wrong just as what judas did was wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow brings good out of it that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment second point of course god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder nor does the good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right yours james kiefer

from jodfishe silver ucs indiana edu joseph dale fisher subject re unity organization indiana university lines in article apr athos rutgers edu maarten van loon cwi nl maarten van loon writes hello fellow netters and fellow christians about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches to bible study group alltough do have personal opinion on this issue thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations my background member of orthodox reformed church let us say little the only unity ve found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples came out of church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything into practice from those messages since becoming disciple ve found that when travel to another church in the same movement they are just as accepting there as any other we had retreat back in january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though had known even the people from louisville for years and had only become disciple the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky one of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self sacrifice that is only one area in which disciples stand out from christians also another part of unity is common depth of conviction ve also been part of some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved lack of conviction about everything they believed that was why they could be unified they didn care about the truth but delighted in getting along together the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches denominations with the same characteristics both have the same confessions there are only some differences with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use our creeds in essence lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is the question creeds what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly better so here is first question can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the scriptures according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going to be there as per previous note mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means there are also differences of opinion and belief however scripture states in the following directives have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than good in the first place hear that when you come together as church there re divisions among you and to some extent believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have god approval corinthians how will god show his approval by fruitfulness see acts but before that there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned in acts god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted look at stephen man full of faith and of the holy spirit acts who was later stoned acts can one say that only one of these three churches is the true church of jesus christ one can say that church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as movement have yet to find that but the closest one ve found is the boston church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected it is also the only one ve seen which is totally sold out to god problem closely related to these question is can we cooperate with other christians from these two churches before there is unity this question is especially important for those who think that only one church can be the true one as for cooperation that can always occur unity on the other hand may never occur as for those who think about only one church being the true one remind them that mark states that there are disciples who are not part of the main group to begin with but they will not lose their reward as with the boston movement ve heard numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there that are not part of the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples of course few people admit that they ve ever run into someone who has the qualities of disciple outside the movement know haven maybe this last problem sounds little strange to most of you for your information we have lot of organizations here which are founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members of that church this has been considered as correct for years only few years ago people started to discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches etc must warn that this sounds cliquey to me clique is group which runs around together to some extent exclusively this causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions would not say at all that this is something correct for church group to do for any reason in one of the churches attended for example there was an internal clique of people who were on the different groups committees organizational heads of the congregation they rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch wish he would ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be disciple anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down but is still there so must warn against such division within there enough division without thanks for your opinions in advance maarten joe fisher

from shellgate llo uu psi com larry overacker subject re sspx schism organization shell oil lines in article apr geneva rutgers edu jhpb sarto budd lake nj us joseph buehler writes descriptions of true and false obedience obedience is not solely matter of compliance refusal the nature of the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to consider someone compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient you also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad you ask where we are would echo that question not trying to be contentious but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions what prevents me from choosing any doctrine like and saying that papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time this is especially true since councils of bishops have basically stood by the pope it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline my question to the supporters of sspx is this is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the pope assuming that the pope position does not change and that the leaders of sspx don jointly make such choice if not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority if adopt the view that not wrong can be wrong and there no way ll change my mind you must change yours that ve either left the catholic church or it has left me the orthodox church does not recognize papal authority jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop and in ecumenical councils we regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be separation of the bishop of rome from the orthodox church without going into the merits of the great schism at least the orthodox agree that split occurred and don paly what appear to be semantic games like he the pope but we don recognize that what he does is effective words aside it appears to be de facto split so where are we are we in another arian heresy complete with weak popes or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers well the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the traditional teaching of the church is we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teaching of the church is if this were simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over years many catholics will decide to side with the pope there is some soundness in this because the papacy is infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all this out thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term may be wrong here not roman catholic what would be the effect of pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation would it be honored if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again not trying to be contentions trying to understand since orthodox ve got no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other schism is superset of disobedience refusal to obey legitimate command all schismatics are disobedient but it superset so it doesn work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics the mere fact that the sspx priests don comply with the holy father desires doesn make them schismatics it does if the command was legitimate sspx does not view the pope commands as legitimate why this is very slippery slope but my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of holy orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction it only confers the power of order the ability to confect the sacraments true enough jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the pope the society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacraments that require bishop one could argue that they are establishing non geographic jurisdiction don know if that even concept or problem in catholic circles larry overacker llo shell com lawrence overacker shell oil company information center houston tx llo shell com

from jek cu nih gov subject etymology of easter lines for src in most languages the feast of the resurrection of our lord is known as the pasch or pasque or some variation thereof word which comes from the hebrew pesach meaning passover in english german and few related languages however it is known as easter or some variation thereof and questions have been asked about the origin of this term one explanation is that given by the venerable bede in his de ratione temporum where he derives the word from the name of an anglo saxon goddess of spring called eastre bede is great scholar and it is natural to take his word for it but he lived and augustine began preaching in kent in the use of the word easter to describe the feast would have been well established before the birth of bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with it seems likely that his derivation is just guess based on his awareness that there had been an anglo saxon goddess of spring bearing that name and the resemblance of the words thus if the said resemblance surely it is not surprising that personification of spring should have name similar to the word for dawn is not in istelf convincing the testimony or rather the conjecture by bede does not make it more so assuming that bede was right that would not justify saying that the christian celebration which after all had been going on for some centuries before the name easter was applied to it has pagan roots it would simply mean that the anglo saxons upon becoming christians and beginning to celebrate the resurrection by festival every spring called it by the name that to them meant simply spring festival however bede is not the only theory that has been proposed knoblech in die sprach zeitschrift fuer vienna offers the following derivation among latin speaking christians the week beginning with the feast of the resurrection was known as hebdomada alba white week since the newly baptized christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week sometimes the week was referred to simply as albae translaters rendering this into german mistook it for the plural of alba meaning dawn they accordingly rendered it as eostarum which is old high german for dawn this gave rise to the form easter in english yours james kiefer no not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety of celebrating easter however this seems like it contains enough interesting information that people might like to see it clh

from caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin subject re the arrogance of christians lines vbv eeap cwru edu virgilio dean velasco jr writes in article apr athos rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes are all truths also absolutes is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes if the answer to either of these questions is no then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of scripture are truths and which truths are absolutes the answer to both questions is yes perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition think you do similarly all truth is absolute indeed non absolute truth is contradiction in terms when is something absolute when it is always true obviously if truth is not always true then we have contradiction in terms simple example in the new testament sorry don have bible at work and can provide reference women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church now this is scripture by your definition this is truth and therefore absolute do women in your church speak do they cover their heads if all scripture is absolute truth it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals yet clearly women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads at least this was the case in the evangelical churches grew up in evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world such statement is terribly self contradictory let me put it to you this way if there are no absolutes shouldn we conclude that the statement there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously we have contradiction here don claim that there are no absolutes think there are very few though and determining absolutes is difficult this is just one of the reasons why christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe there is hardly consensus even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe but you are claiming that all of scripture is absolute how can you determine absolutes derived from scripture when you can agree how to interpret the scripture it very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own interpretation is absolute do you deny that your own background education prejudices etc come into play when you read the bible and determine how to interpret passsage do you deny that you in fact interpret carol alvin caralv auto trol com

from jhpb sarto budd lake nj us joseph buehler subject re sspx schism organization none lines larry overacker writes responding to simon may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net my understanding is that sspx does not consider itself in schism or legitimately excommunicated but that really beside the point what does the roman catholic church say excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication as provided for in canon law here some of the theology involved for the interested there is confusion over this issue of the sspx schism often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism take the various classifications of obedience first there are important elements involved here for my purposes command the response made to the command as far as the command goes commands can be legitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to not eat meat on fridays or they can be illegitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to worship the god dagon when every other full moon comes around as far as the response to command goes it can be to refuse to do what is commanded or to comply making table there are thus possibilites command response name legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience so now you see where my classifications of obedience come from obedience is not solely matter of compliance refusal the nature of the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to consider someone compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient you also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad in my example if the pope commands all catholics to worship the god dagon and they all refuse they aren being disobedient at all as far as the society of saint pius goes they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the pope desires but that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient you also have to consider the nature of the papal desires and there the rub sspx says the popes since vatican ii have been commanding certain very bad things for the church the popes have of course disagreed so where are we are we in another arian heresy complete with weak popes or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers well the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the traditional teaching of the church is the problem here is that very few catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on and what the issues are the religion of american catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth you will never read about the issues being discussed in the catholic press in this country on the other hand one italian catholic magazine get days has had interviews with the superior general of the society of saint pius many catholics will decide to side with the pope there is some soundness in this because the papacy is infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all this out but on the other hand there is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the popes may indeed be wrong and such catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they re wrong in fact if the situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him at the very least they re wasting great opportunity because they are failing to love christ in heroic way at the very time that he needs this badly schism let move on to schism what is it schism is superset of disobedience refusal to obey legitimate command all schismatics are disobedient but it superset so it doesn work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics the mere fact that the sspx priests don comply with the holy father desires doesn make them schismatics so what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute schism maybe this something else makes the sspx priests schismatics you must add this the rejection of the right to command look in any decent reference on catholic theology and that what you ll find the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command here what the catholic encyclopedia says for example not every disobedience is schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors denial of their divine right to command from the ce article schism is the society of saint pius then schismatic the answer is clear no they say that the pope is their boss they pray for him every day and that all that matters as far as schism goes what all this boils down to is this if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections their position is legitimate one as far as the catholic theology of obedience and schism goes they are resisting certain papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the papacy and the best interests of the church in fact someone who finds himself in this situation has duty to resist now what is the stance of rome on all this well if you read the holy father motu proprio ecclesia dei you can find out it the definitive document on the subject motu proprio is specifically papal act it not the product of roman congregation letter that the pope has possibly never even read it from the pope himself his boss is god there no one else to complain to in this document the holy father says among other things the episcopal consecrations performed by archbishop lefebvre constituted schismatic act archbishop lefebvre problem was of the nature of tradtion both are confusing fail to see the logic of the pope points as far as the episcopal consecrations go read an interesting article in translation of the italian magazine si si no no it all gets back to the question of jurisdiction if episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the pope jurisdiction then they would truly constitute schismatic act justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law but my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of holy orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction it only confers the power of order the ability to confect the sacraments jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the pope the society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacraments that require bishop the si si no no article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the pope said what he did is that he has novel post vatican ii idea of holy orders according to this idea episcopal consecration does confer jurisdiction lent the article to friend unfortunately so can tell you more believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea the pope thinking on this point remains great puzzle to me there no way there is schism according to traditional catholic theology so why does the pope think this as far as the points regarding the nature of tradition goes here the passage in question the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of tradtion incomplete because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of tradition which as the second vatican council clearly taught comes from the apostles and progresses in the church with the help of the holy spirit there is growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on this comes about in various ways it comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts it comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience and it comes from the preaching of those who have received along with their right of succession in the espiscopate the sure charism of truth but especially contradictory is notion of tradition which opposes the universal magisterium of the church possessed by the bishop of rome and the body of bishops it is impossible to remain faithful to the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom in the person of the apostle peter christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in his church papal motu proprio ecclesia dei july it seems to me that the holy father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following vatican council ii has happened am the pope the argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that archbishop lefebvre must be wrong because he disagrees with them this is weak to say the least it would have helped clarify things more if the pope had addressed archbishop lefebvre concerns in detail what is john paul ii stand on the social kingship of christ as taught by gregory xvi pius ix leo xiii pius xi and pius xii for example are we supposed to ignore what all these popes said on the subject don know what the future will hold but the powers that be in the sspx are still talking with rome and trying to straighten things out many people would prefer to call justified refusal to obey justified disobedience or even obeying god rather than man calling refusal to obey obedience puts us into sort of alice in wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean similarly schism indicates formal break in the church if the pope says that schism exists it seems to me that by definition it exists it may be that the pope is on the wrong side of the break that there is no good reason for the break to exist and that it will shortly be healed but how can one deny that it does in fact exist it seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform the power of the papacy what good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the pope in the future but in the process you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline it one thing to hold that the pope has misused his powers and excommunicated someone wrongly it something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect and the schism is all in his imagination that means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools but acts whose validity is open to debate generally it has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the pope while they have often objected to church sanctions generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist you are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying and to be in communion while excommunicated this would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command that you say defines schism clh
from jek cu nih gov subject when are two people married lines listowner have sent this to mr anderson privately post it only if you think it of general interest here is copy of something wrote for another list you may find it relevant listmember asks what makes common law marriages wrong common law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself there is nothing in the bible old or new testament about getting married by preacher or by priest jewish or christian and in fact jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings there is common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman in fact the traditional christian view at least in the west is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage and that the clergyman is there only as witness however the essential ingredient of marriage is mutual commitment two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife forsaking all others till death do them part the reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society and the couple themselves may be clear about whether commitment has been made suppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vows etc instead we have man and woman settling down to live together after year or so the man says to the woman hey honey it was great while it lasted but think it time to move on she says what are you talking about he says am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger she says but you can we are married he says what are you talking about we never got married she says remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love you said my love for you is as deep as the ocean as eternal as the stars as long as live am yours utterly and completely when lie on my deathbed my last feeble breath will utter your name my he says oh that that was just rhetoric just poetry when man is in romantic mood he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that you mustn take them literally and that is why you have an insistence on formal ceremony that is matter of public record the church insists on it because it is her duty among other things to give moral advice and you cannot give man moral advice about his relations with woman if you have no idea who is married to whom if anybody and vice versa the state insists on it since the state has concern with property rights with child care and support and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom prospective fathers in law insist on it because they don want their daughters seduced and abandoned prospective spouses insist on it because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is real commitment or just poetry and persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric this is the real thing hence the insistence on formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment the church goes further and insists that when christians marry clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the church not because it is impossible to have valid wedding without clergyman but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching about marriage is and that they are in fact promising to be married in christian sense the church also prefers standard marriage vow and is wary of letting couples write their own vows for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up will or contract certain language has been repeatedly used in wills and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it try to say the same thing in your own words and you may find that the probate judge interpretation of them is not at all what you intended similarly the church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether you are my main squeeze and am here for the long haul do in fact cover the same territory as forsaking all others and till death do us part this topic has come up on the list before is there any topic that hasn one listmember was asking if couple love each other and are living together isn that marriage in the eyes of god eventually someone asked in that case what is their status if they break up is that the moral equivalent of getting divorce are they in relationship that god forbids either of them to walk out on the original questioner said good grief never thought of that in fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says we don need piece of paper or ceremony in front of judge or preacher in order to show that we love each other is trying to have it both ways to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with minimum of bother at this point someone may say none of this applies to me and my mate we are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed lifelong commitment for better or worse forsaking all others till death us do part so in our case no ceremony is needed to this my reply would be the reason for requiring driver license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road what is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers but the existence of dangerous drivers however testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road therefore the state rightly makes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without license no matter how much of hotshot behind the wheel you think you are back to the original question we have listmember who knows couple who have been living together for around years he asks at what point did they stop fornicating and start being married answer at the point if any where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other for better or worse as long as they both lived if they have accepted such an obligation what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of say justice of the peace yours james kiefer

from dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius_lecointe subject re sabbath admissions of organization florida state university lines in response to some of the discussions on the sabbath andrew byler commented that if we really followed sola scriptura we would worship on saturday the change to sunday was law made by the church and we don acknowledge its authority to make laws noted that protestants do not consider sunday worship law clh he was not referring to the faq but to the five sabbath admissions posted on the bible study group this is what prompted someone to send the faq to me the argument against the sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on christians you cannot show from scripture that the weekly sabbath is part of the ceremonial laws before you post text in reply investigate its context if you accept that the sabbath is not binding on christians then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual christians or since worship is by its nature group activity churches are free to decide can the churches also decide what is and is not sin interesting where there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of operation but we cannot be as creative with what god has explicitly spoken on darius again in the normal protestant interpretation sunday is not law and worshipping on another day is not sin churches are free to decide on the day they will meet just as they are free to decide on the hour it would not be sin to worship on some other day but if you belong to church that worships on sunday and you show up on monday you will probably worship alone clh

from kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko subject re atheist views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart organization university of oulu finland lines jason smith jasons atlastele com wrote the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman mind there must be causal event no reasonable alternative exists would argue that causality is actually property of spacetime causes precede their effects but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer have always wondered why christians use the there are questions science or atheism cannot answer argument hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question the most popular question is the question of origins why does the universe exist or anything for that matter think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question however is it meaningful question after all would say it isn consider the following die hard skeptic being be it human or whatever attempts to doubt one very existence since it is so easy to doubt everything else cannot be the world exists it may be my mind fooling me can ever be sure exist however it is only possible to exist or not to exist someone insert an appropriate shakespeare quote here being that does not exist cannot doubt one existence being that does exist can doubt one existence but this would be pointless the being would exist anyway let us return to the original question why being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non existence this being is not whether anything else exists but his mind but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind the objectivity postulate the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don exist don exist tautology at its best seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question some christians have talked to have said that actually god is himself the existence however see several problems with this answer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually existence good and evil devils and angels us and them this is pantheism not christianity another answer is that god is the of all existence this sounds much better but am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this argument sounds like god does not exist but meta exists and from his meta existent perspective he created existence think this is actually nonsolution mere twist of words the best answer have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions being an atheist myself do not accept such answers since do not have any other methods the second question how did the universe emerge from nothing belongs to the domain of science and for one do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum this possibility has been suggested in recent hawking biography see also lizhi shuxian creation of the universe world scientific however think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this as far as can tell the very laws of nature demand why that isn true of something outside of nature super natural this is not true science is collection of models telling us how not why something happens cannot see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining reproducing life ever ve never been much of prophet though can even picture new york in my mind don believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinion this opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow different from inanimate systems do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in lab there is problem with your prophecy artificial life has been created although not yet in chemical form computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium although their code is electronic as well as their metabolism see recent book steven levy artificial life the quest for new creation jonathan cape london artificial chemical life is just around the corner after all no spark of life has been found to be necessary living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them you don mind if few of us send up prayer on your behalf during your research do you after all if we of christ are deluding ourselves you really have nothing to worry about eh exactly this is why think atheists should post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc religion groups since people who seek to find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together would normally have asked these questions in alt atheism or

from jodfishe silver ucs indiana edu joseph dale fisher subject re eternity of hell was re hell organization indiana university lines in article apr athos rutgers edu dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius_lecointe writes insert deletion of unnecessary quote why is it that we have this notion that god takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people the purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels first of all god does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion ex however if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell then why would he send jesus to seek and save that which was lost luke to the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed remember the bible teaches that god has reserved them until the day of judgement their judgement is soon to come let me suggest this maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it stay away from human theories and only take into account references in the bible you asked for it peter ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished matthew is also very clear that those who do not righteous in god eyes will be sent to hell for eternity thessalonians states that those who cause trouble for the disciples will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord thessalonians talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned revelation talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not those who do not listed in verse will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur revelation gives the indication that those who follow the beast will be tormented with burning sulfur and there being no rest day or night for them because of it psalm the wicked return to the grave all the nations that forget god think those should be sufficient to prove the point darius joe fisher in the following mostly playing devil advocate not advocating either position my concern is that people understand that it possible to see these passages in different ways it possible to see eternal destruction as just that destruction rev often uses the term second death the most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction the problem is that the nt speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death it uses terms that can be understood either way my concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other but to help people understand that there wide enough variety of images that it possible to understand them either way as tom albrecht commented the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire whatever the details to make things more interesting luke implies that the damned don get resurrected at all presumably they just stay dead yes aware that it possible to understand this passage in non literal way peter ff is talking about angels and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement this isn eternal punishement matthew talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels the fact that the fire is eternal doesn mean that people will last in its flames forever particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels rev and talk about the eternal fire as well they say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it when talking about people being thrown into it it is referred to as the second death this sounds more like extinction than eternal torment is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil and humans thessalonians similarly what is everlasting destruction this is not necessarily eternal torment this one can clearly be understood either way but think it at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity thessalonians again talks about destruction revelation see comment above revelation is probably the best of the quotes even there it doesn explicitly say that the people suffer forever it says that the smoke and presumably the fire is eternal and that there is no respite from it but it doesn say that the people are tormented forever psalm don see that it says anything relevant to this issue clh

from db andrew cmu edu andrew byler subject re sabbath admissions of organization freshman civil engineering carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines all of the arguments concerning the sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear anyone outside of the catholic or orthodox oranglican or monophysite churches ourght to worship on saturday if they are really sola scriptura otherwise they are following law put into effect by the church and only the above chruches really recognize any power of the chruch to do so andy byler you will note that nothing in the faq said anything about the church establishing or changing law the argument against the sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on christians this argument is based on paul letters acts and in more general sense jesus teachings further most people argue that scripture shows worship occuring on sunday and paul endorsing it understand that these points are disputed and do not want to go around the dispute one more time the point making here is not that these arguments are right but that the backing they claim is scripture accepting the principle of sola scriptura does not commit us to obeying the entire jewish law acts and paul letters are quite clear on that think even the sda accept it the disagreement is on where the bible would have us place the line by the way protestants do give authority to the church in matters that are not dictated by god that why churches are free to determine their own liturgies church polity etc if you accept that the sabbath is not binding on christians then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual christians or since worship is by its nature group activity churches are free to decide clh

from rexlex fnal fnal gov subject re certainty and arrogance organization fnal ad net lines in article apr geneva rutgers edu kilroy gboro rowan edu dr nancy sweetie writes someone called rexlex has claimed that there is way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism will answer this as find time rexlex suggested that people read is there and he is not silent_ by francis schaeffer didn think very highly of it but think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many evangelical christians somebody else might like it though so don let my opinion stop you from reading it if someone is interested in my opinion suggest certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein darren provine kilroy gboro rowan edu if any substantial number of talk religion misc readers read some wittgenstein of the postings would disappear if they understood some wittgenstein would disappear michael siemon notice what said about this book called it easy reading the reason dropped philosphy as my major was because ran into too many pharisaical simon don know how many walking encyclopedia ran across in philosphy classes the problem isn in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person the problem comes when you become puffed up about it schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person that was who he was writting to suppose that you would have criticised john that his gospel was to simple ve talked with schaeffer one on one ve been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof from secular as well as christian universities nd alone would fill both those catagories his answers were enough that the prof themselves often were taken back and caused to re think what their question was saw this time and time again at different open forums so yes schaeffers books are by in large well simplistic it certainly isn grad level reading but we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time also one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by insistent inquisitiveness one cannot live his life constantly from cartisian doubt base look the christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality but we must add qualification to give this balance christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place we never know the value of thing until we know its limits put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value this is why xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic it also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism and not christian faith which leads to irrationality if we forget the limits of thing we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life more without limits is less less with limits is more or as have so often stated it freedom without form soon becomes form freedom let put it another way the rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery think about that it can tell the difference between the two if you will let it christianity contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it but that it has very little else when christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding this is where the principle of suspended judgment applies at such time if the christian faith is to be itself and let god be god it must suspend judgment and say father do not understand you but trust you now don read all your objections of me into that statement wasn saying do not understand you at all but trust you anyway it means that do not understand you in this situation but do understand why trust you anyway therefore can trust that you understand even though do not the former is mystery unrelieved by rationality and from absurdity the latter is statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of faith so the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational it is not leap of faith but walk of faith as believers we cannot always know why but we canalways know why we trust god who knows why and this makes all the difference now there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where have parted company with philosophy what is eminently reasonable in theory is rather bit more difficult in practice in practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent whying of year old it isn just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we cannot know the one produces frustration because curiosity is denied the other leads to genuine anguish more specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith if we do not know why we trust god then we will always need to know exactly what god is doing in order to trust him failing to grasp that we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust if on the other hand we do know why we trust god we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what he is doing too many xian leaders teach as if the christian had window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall for what god is doing may be ambiguous but it will not be inherently contradictory it may be mystery to us but mystery is only inscrutable what would be insufferable is absurdity and that my friend was the conclusion of nietzche both in theory and in practice rex

from hall vice ico tek com hal lillywhite subject re ancient books organization tektronix inc beaverton or lines sent in something on this before but believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described this is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time hl the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of friedrich blass hermeneutrik und kritik und vol of der klassischen altertums wissenshaft_ noerdlingen beck portions of this are described in nibley prophetic book op mormon_ pp slc deseret book if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned nibley describes blass as typical german scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader nibley extract from blass work is in the form of rules for forgers it makes interesting reading confess that have not read blass work only nibley extract thereof my german falls far short of what would be required and as far as know there is no english translation available however believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is later forgery actually there are types of purportedly ancient documents alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof for example the dead sea scrolls these can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper inks and objects found with them this can provide pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find document which monks in monastary claim is copy of something from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several generations of copists this is more of problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple we cannot expect test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be they can only date the document and identify its culture of origin for example ve heard of letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to king in what is now iraq if this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the holograph they could check the language content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of palestinian jew of that time however even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually wrote it we would know what time and culture it came from but barring known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there there is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was as say no expert on blas work do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works specifically we might ask is the document internally consistent does it contradict itself if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it is forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents is it consistent with the history and geography of the time again short non specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter day forger would be able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check the devil is in the details what about the literary style of the work figures of speech etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us are there any such odd phrases in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there are complications if the document has been translated or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies they cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don necessarily prove forgery these tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy they require the skills of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the questions to ask are is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin if there are things which don fit how significant are they are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies however often it may just be probability or an indication that the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions this is often unsettling to generation raised on tv where all problems are solved in to minutes with time out for commercials it is however the real world and what scholarship has to offer

from af yfn ysu edu frank decenso jr subject major views of the trinity organization youngstown state youngstown free net lines with frank permission have added some information here and in one case changed the order of his contributions in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views my comments are based primarily on william rusch historical summary in the trinitarian controversy fortress going to save this as an faq clh major views of the trinity second century the writers of the nd cent are important because they set up much of the context for the later discussions justin martyr aristides athenagoras tatian and theophilus of antioch are known as the apologists their theology has often been described as logos theology based strongly on wording in john they took more or less two phase approach through eternity the logos was with the father as his mind or thought this immanent word became expressed as god revealed himself in history ultimately in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the father only became visible in history though the logos had been present in god from eternity rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position but in form which is less sophisticated because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists however he was uncomfortable with the two stage approach he still viewed god as one personage with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self revelation the economy the distinctions are present in his essential nature irenaeus emphasized the holy spirit more than the apologists irenaeus views should probably be called economic trinitarianism though that term is normally used as below to refer to later developments third century clh dynamic monarchianism source theodotus adherents paul of samosota artemon socinus modern unitarians perception of god essence the unity of god denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person the son and the holy spirit therefore are consubstantial with the father divine essence only as impersonal attributes the divine dunamis came upon the man jesus but he was not god in the strict sense of the word perception of god subsistence the notion of subsistent god is palpable impossibility since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible the diversity of god is apparent and not real since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to dynamic operation within god not to hypostatic union asignation of deity eternality father unique originator of the universe he is eternal self existent and without beginning or end son virtuous but finite man in whose life god was dynamically present in unique way christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternality is ascribed to the holy spirit criticism elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the trinity categorically denies the deity of christ and of the holy spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation in summary this probably best thought of as not being trinitarianism at all god is an one son and holy spirit are seen as simply names for the man jesus and the grace of god active in the church clh modalistic monarchianism source praxeas adherents noatus sabellius swedenborg scleiermacher united pentecostals jesus only perception of god essence the unity of god is ultra simplex he is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person this essence may be designated interchangeably as father son and holy spirit they are different names for but identical with the unified simplex god the three names are the three modes by which god reveals himself perception of god subsistence the concept of subsistent god is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of god modalistic manifesting of himself the paradox of subsisting three in oneness is refuted by recognizing that god is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of drama asignation of deity eternality father fully god and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary god son full deity eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one god and identical with his essence he is the same god manifested in temporal sequence specific to role incarnation holy spirit eternal god only as the tile designates the phase in which the one god in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification criticism depersonalizes the godhead to compensate for its trinitarian deficiencies this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical its concept of successive manifestations of the godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at christ baptism rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy there are actually two slightly different groups included noetus and his followers and sabellius noetus was apparently more extreme sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of economic trinitarianism to create more sophisticated view unfortunately information about sabellius comes from century later and there seems to be some confusion between him and marcellus of ancyra clh ve moved the following description to be with the other third century views it originally appeared near the end clh economic trinitarianism source hippolytus tertullian adherents various neo economic trinitarians perception of god essence the godhead is characterized by triunity father son and holy spirit are the three manifestations of one identical indivisible substance the perfect unity and are especially comprehended in such manifest triadic deeds as creation and redemption perception of god subsistence subsistence within the godhead is articulated by means of such terms as distinction and distribution dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division asignation of deity eternality the equal deity of father son and holy spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational operational features of the godhead co eternality at times does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view but it seems to be logical implication criticism is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity note that this is development of the apologists and irenaeus as mentioned above as with them the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that god revealed himself in history however they did say that this is manifestation of plurality that is somehow present in the godhead from the beginning tertullian talks of the father son and holy spirit as being three that are one in substance many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox but with less developed philosophical categories clh origen developing further an approach started by clement attempted to apply neo platonism to christian thought he set many of the terms of the coming battle in platonic fashion he sees the son as mediator mediating between the absolute one of god and the plurality of creating beings the son is generated but he is eternally generated that is the relationship between father and son is eternal it cannot be said that there was once when he was not phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries having the son is intrinsic to his concept of god the father and son are described as separate hypostases though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts the union is one of love and action but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios of the same substance the holy spirit is also an active personal substance originated by the father through the son origen intent is trinitarian not tritheistic but he pushes things in the direction of separateness fourth century clh often called arianism clh source arius major adherents modern jehovah witnesses and several other lesser known cults perception of god essence the inherent oneness of god nature is properly identifiable with the father only the son and the holy spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence perception of god subsistence the unipersonal essence of god precludes the concept of divine subsistence with godhead threeness in oneness is self contradictory and violates biblical principles of monotheistic god asignation of deity eternality father the only one unbegotten god who is eternal and without beginning son created being and therefore not eternal though he is to be venerated he is not of the divine essence holy spirit nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the father he is viewed as an influence an expression of god deity is not ascribed to him criticism it is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both christ and the holy spirit its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the father christ and the holy spirit this results in totally confused soteriology note also that in most versions of this view the son is not fully human either he is supernatural and sinless that distinguishes this view from adoptionism clh orthodox trinitarianism source athanasius adherents basil gregory of nyssa gregory of nazianzus augustine thomas aquinas luther calvin contemporary orthodox christianity perception of god essence god being is perfectly unified and simplex of one essence this essence of deity is held in common by father son and holy spirit the three persons are consubstantial coinherent co equal and co eternal perception of god subsistence the divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases as such the godhead exists undivided in divided persons this view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the godhead asignation of deity eternality in its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth father son and holy spirit as co equal and co eternal in the godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function criticism the only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of three in oneness at least in the th cent there were several different approaches all of which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but which are somewhat different in detail nicea was originally held to respond to arius arius can be thought of as carrying origen thought bit too far to the point of making the son separate entity in general the east tended to take an approach based on origen and it was hard to get acceptance of nicea in the east its final acceptance was based on the work of athanasius with the cappadocians gregory of nyssa and gregory of nazianzus among others while starting with three they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being single god this allowed the council of constantinople in to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia clh adapted from of christian theology and

from gideon otago ac nz gideon king subject should christians fight justifiable war organization university of otago lines posted this couple of weeks ago and it doesn seem to have appeared on the newsgroup and haven had reply from the moderator we were having intermittent problems with our mail at the time please excuse me if you have seen this before should christians fight last week alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there are such things as justifiable wars have started looking into these things and have jotted down my findings as go haven answered all his questions yet and know what have here is on slightly different tack but possibly ll be able to get into it more deeply later and post some more info soon our duty to our neighbour do good to all men gal love our neighbour as ourselves matt act the part of the good samaritan luke toward any who may be in trouble we will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured man and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes people harm even medical corps of the army etc christians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of israel ephesians and also recognise that god rules in the kingdoms of men and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith we are to be strangers and pilgrims amongst the nations so we are just passing through and not part of any nation or any national aspirations this can also be applied to politics etc but that another story we are not supposed to strive or resist evil even suffer yourselves to be defrauded it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in preserving state which christ will destroy when he returns to set up god kingdom our duty to the state render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar and unto god the things which be god luke let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god rom submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord sake whether it be to king as supreme for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men pet these scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is divine command but it is equally clear from acts that when any ordinance of man runs counter to god law we must refuse submission to it the reason for this is that we are god bond servants and his service is our life task an example of the type of thing is in col where bondservants were to work heartily as unto the lord so also we should work as if our boss was god pressed down shaken together and running over oops bit of side track there in the contests between the nations we are on god side side that is not fighting in the battle but is testifying to the truth when we believe in god and embrace his promises we become fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are no longer interested in associations of the world think of this in relation to unions etc as well paul tells us to lay aside every weight that we may run the race that is set before us and if we are wise we will discard any association which would retard our progress thou therefore endure hardness as good soldier of jesus christ no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be soldier tim one of these entanglements he warns about is be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers one of the obvious applications of this is marriage with unbelievers but it also covers things like business partnerships and any other position where we may form close association with any person or persons not believing the truth about god in this case the army the principle comes from deut remember that as well as them being different animals of different strengths one was clean and one unclean under the law these ideas are strongly stressed in cor suggest you read this the yoking also has another aspect that of servitude and jesus says take my yoke upon you so we are then yoked with christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers we have already seen that we are bondservants of christ and paul says become not ye the bondservants of men cor rv an example from the old testament the question is asked in chr shouldest thou help the ungodly the situation here is good example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life here are the facts he had made an affinity with ahab who had sold himself to work wickedness before the lord kings when asked by ahab to form military alliance he had agreed and said am as thou art my people as thy people kings an unequal yoking he sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted on hearing the prophet of the lord trying to do the right thing he found that he was yoked and therefore couldn break away from the evil association he had made god says to us come out from among them and be ye separate and touch not the unclean thing and will receive you and ye shall be my sons and daughters cor this is more or less what have found out so far still looking into it as don think ve answered all the questions raised by alastair yet heres summary and few things to think about the christian in under command obedience to this command is an essential factor in his relationship with christ john total dedication to this course of action is required romans disobedience compromises the close relationship between christ and his followers pet we are to be separated to god rom this involves master servant relationship rom no man can serve two masters matt all that is in the kosmos is lust and pride quite opposed to gos john christs kingdom is not of this world not worldly in nature if it was his servants would fight to deliver him if christ is our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom was not of this world then his servants cannot possibly fight for another master strangers and pilgrims have no rights and we cannot swear allegiance to anyone but god the servant of the lord must not war but be gentle to all tim this does not just apply to war but also to avoiding strife throughout our lives there is war to be waged not with man weapons cor but with god armour eph ll probably post some more when ve had time to look into things bit further gideon king phone university of otago fax

from steve hayes fidonet org subject pantheism lines apr susan harwood kaczmarczik writes to all we suspect that because one party to the environmental dispute thinks the earth is sanctified it clear that much of the energy is derived from what has been called the religious left secular or even pagan fanaticism that now worships such gods as nature and gender with reverence formerly accorded real religions emphasis mine shk first of all secular and pagan are not synonyms pagan which is shk derived from the latin paganus means of the country it is in shk fact cognate with the italian paisano which means peasant shk paganism among other things includes reverence for the planet and shk all life on the planet stemming from the belief that all life is shk interconnected so rather than be something secular it is something shk very sacred would go further and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview or by the humanist worldview and especially by the secular humanist worldview this is not to say that all secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment and am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment but at the time of the renaissance and ref ormation in western europe man became the centre or the focus of culture hence humanism this consciousness was also secular in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age ather than the age to come capitalism arose at the same time and the power of economics became central in philosophy this doesn mean that economics did not exist before simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of western european society and its offshoots this cultural shift was in its later stages accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified them there was fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of economics from the christian view of man as the economos the steward of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers there were denominational differences among the new worshippers of mammon for some the name of the deity was the free rein of the market mechanism while for others it was the dialectical forces of history but in both the capitalist west and the socialist east the environment was sacrificed on the altar of mammon the situation was mitigated in the west because thos who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case steve golded
from bfinnert chaph usc edu brian finnerty subject mary assumption organization university of southern california los angeles ca lines few points about mary being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth one piece of evidence for mary assumption into heaven is the fact that no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried some christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of peter mark and other saints but no one ever claimed to possess the body of mary the greatest of the saints why because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of mary some passages seem suggestive like the passage in revelation that describes woman giving birth to son and later being crowned in the heavens of course the woman in this passage has other interpretations she can also be taken symbol for the church the assumption of mary makes sense because of her relationship to christ jesus perfect god and perfect man fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly under the law god gave to us we are to honor our mother and father and christ act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law also he took his flesh from her so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave one last point an ex catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to belief that mary did not die this is not correct summary of what catholics believe the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether mary did or did not die in fact the consensus among catholic theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die this would make sense christ died and his mother who waited at the foot of the cross would want to share in his death brian finnerty

here as an immature flame start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience the human being is an who has due to his her advanced mental facilities developed religious as satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable hmmm there are other animals on this planet with advanced mental facilities which have not developed religion as satisfactory explaination for the unexplained why is this so further it appears that only humans have need to explain the unexplained why is this so the other animals on this planet including those with advanced mental facilities seem perfectly content in their ignorance like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me from your unsupported statement they are humans are animal only religion exists as crutch so that the unexplained need not be researched religion was made up by humans to address perceived need the biological aspect of humans is deified that is all aspects of human life can be categorized in hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needless to say disagree with your strong opinion and the underlying presuppositions christianity is an infectious cult the reasons it flourishes are because it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life safety blanked to hide behind oh wow all have to do is follow this christian moral standard and get eternal happiness for all of you found jeezus how many of you were on the brink disagree that christianity is an infectious cult it has certainly shown itself to be persistent as belief system in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is infectious in derrogatory sense it may be that it provides workable system for its adherents and would argue that this is the case disagree that christianity is safety blanket which supplants hope and purpose rather it points an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there is nothing hidden about christian source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose is the apparent loss of control over one own life the problem or is it something else finally one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following christian moral standards indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections moral standards are merely guides to the christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian in the person of god spirit heaven is one of two final states that christian doctrine postulates however christians are generally not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here and now but digress the other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature best friend of mine breifly entered christian group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this priority spread the word many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as priority and rightly so for it was jesus himself who gave this as priority for his followers however it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits of christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non christian to seek out the christian to ask why needless to say such demonstration is not easily accom plished it takes radical committment to the person of jesus it does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian is required and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who cannot evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being friend is to gain conversion as long time christian nearly years view with some skep ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate hurry up attitude pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes he was coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings conviction of wrong doing to people am content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we are animals we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die we are far more than animals we sleep eat reproduce and die just as other animals do true but we are also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is so limited can only hope and pray that you will someday find more expansive view for reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing arts that humans do how is it that humans can learn the language of other humans or animals but that other animals cannot do so how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social structures whereas other animals have only one structure religion especially christianity is nothing more than drug blatant assertion christianity is not physically addictive christianity is not psychologically addictive christianity is not thing which one snorts ingests shoots up it is relationship with living being you might as validly characterize any close knit relationship with this appelation some people use drugs as an escape from reality christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high there are jesus freaks who let the emotional aspects of worship and christian living gain and retain the upper hand even so this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these things flow it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars of which christianity has had no small part guilty by association that christianity which forces itself upon another is not christianity at all when christians see non believer they say that person is blind to the truth but they cannot realize that it is who live with this mask of fakeness each day jesus was just prophet who happened to have large influence because at that time the romans were circa ad dispersing the jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened years ago how did you come by it cannot accept your conclusion that jesus influence was sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in ad he was years gone by this time it strains the bounds of credulity to assert that nothing about jesus life was noteworthy the sack must go these are but few of my thoughts on christianity christianity is having relationship with jesus christ himself what do you know of him we read the world wrong phil buckland and say that it

from mserv mozart cc iup edu mail server subject re cause lines trajan cwis unomaha edu stephen mcintyre writes norris athena mit edu writes some stuff deleted fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science for example why does the universe exist at all must there be why to this ask because of what you also assume about god namely that he just exists with no why to his existence so the question is reversed why can we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to just exist why must there be why to the universe remainder of message deleted pardon me for replying to only portion of your message the reason we can say god just exists and can say the universe just exists is because the universe is natural realm and is subject to natural laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular that is we observe in nature that every cause has an effect and every effect was produced by cause the existence of the natural realm as an effect itself cannot be its own cause it must therefore have supernatural cause god on the other hand is supernatural being and is therefore not subject to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect as supernatural being god eternal existence does not imply previous cause the way the existence of physical natural cosmos does thus those who believe in the supernatural have valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused phenomena such as the eternal god whereas those who deny the existence of the supernatural are faced with the dilemma of physical universe whose very nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence this is of course an of complex topic but just wanted to clarify some important differences between the supernatural god and the natural the universe since you seem to mistake them as being interchangeable mark

from maridai comm mot com marida ignacio subject refusing divine peace and alive prayer was re question about mary organization trunking_fixed lines it like refusing god kingdom come in one of jesus revelation in this century same thing as in the old days people refuse to believe my messengers even when was alive here on earth they refuse me what more when am just talking through somebody else paraphrased with all the knowledge believers accumulated he would think that we would be enlightened enough to detect which ones are authentic and divine as opposed to evil or man made these signs these miracles are you afraid that they are not from god that these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking they are evil well is faith in god evil is true peace evil is true love that is divine and pure evil why can someone accept that god can do what he wants in fulfillment of his generous love and jesus never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to him for salvation why are we refusing god messenger of this truth the mother to all who are in christ what brings us these fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us which in contrary could be pleasing to god fears of being humbled fears of being judged as wrong wrt mainstream standard of what is right why can we tolerate non believers mockery or ridicule of us for the sake of peace love and obedience to god the humbling lessons left to us by martyrs and saints we rather engage in never ending bickering and disproof of each other opinion looking at each other mistakes for the sake of arguments instead of having communion in one body with christ what makes us go blind to the truth that god is all powerful and that he can not be binded by what people wrote and have written about him in all ages why is our faith in god limited by all the words and literature we muster what prevents us from going beyond being saved and extend god rich love to others who are not why are our eyes not wide open to see that he continuously sees our faith hope and love which glorify him and so he gives us indications of his with signs miracles ordinary common or divinely inspired everywhere isn that like an atheist agnostic view that all these are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural why then does the holy mother comes back to remind us we must really that prayer__ changes the course of things and that with prayers wars can be prevented__ but then she continues you often have an egotistic attitude dear children in these days you have prayed very much your hands have remained empty__ why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done prayer conversion peace penance fasting the holy mass living life as what the gospel brings why not do so how to the world to this the mother says start in your family be good example live the word why worry if it is going to be of good use to many our holy mother says the fruits them to the lord__ do not worry about anything or anyone but entrust yourself to the lord although the holy mother does not insist because you are free bow before the freedom which god gives you but she follows this with you are surprised because say to you decide for god and yet see how you have lived this day why does she constantly conveys take this life toward god in the way as to the lord himself in your and only__ when you pray or one time when we decide that we are saved or talk write about god etc the holy mother warns satan the serpent is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from my peace plan and prayer rev the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings those who keep god commandments and bear witness to jesus do you have fear or hate for god current messenger of true peace love and our motherly protector from the anti christ the one who is being apprehensive of communism wars famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us this obedient and blessed new eve the mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against satan haven there been renewed faith hope love peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that god has given her in good purpose why do we choose to be blind why fear the truth that god has been giving us chance and sharing christ ever forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother the mother who has been consecrated the task reverse__ the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient eve she has been preparing the new eden with her immaculate heart the new eden as sanctuary the womb for the next coming and judgement of the righteous by our lord jesus christ when the lamb marries his bride shouldn we give her hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the son of god in her womb why fear true peace love and renewed faith and obedience to god that mary faithfully brings to god children she has been protecting the flock the rest of the offsprings from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her son coming not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief with prayer and guidance from the holy spirit and of course approval of our church authorities we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones specifically the ones which aligns with the scripture also our lady reminds us of recommendation of in our prayers if you speak unceasingly in your prayers how will you be able to hear god allow him room to answer you to speak to you she encourages us with motherly nurturing to continue in exuberant faith hope and love to jesus constantly not with mere emotions but with deep constant obedience to jesus her beloved son and acknowledgement of our need to have him as part of our lives let not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that god wants us to live when there won be enough time or when it will be late nowadays mary says pray pray pray for peace reconciliation my children have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others for without peace you can not fully accept my son and you think she just an ordinary lady not to me she our good mother messenger from god and she is so nice enough to share god kingdom to us through her son and experience it with mary we are assured that the lamb always succeeds note all enclosed in quotes are from latest news of medjugorje number june by fr rene laurentin new mother of eden most pure preparing the sanctuary for true christians cleansing us with peace for god kingdom come bring us to your loving protective and obedient church that we may belong in one body to your son jesus

from db andrew cmu edu andrew byler subject monophysites and mike walker lines mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity it consequence of the fall jesus is human but not fallen human clh the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism this was heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox it believes that jesus christ was god which is correct that he was man which is correct that he was one person which is correct but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy which is heretical the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies both divine and human though the wills were in perfect harmony that is what mike is trying to get across that while jesus came in human form mike says he did not have human nature or human will in reality he had both though neither made him subject to original sin it is interesting to note that the monothelites were reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies it also was condemned at late council in constantinople believe andy byler these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology don think there any question that there is problem with nestorius and would agree that the saying christ had human form without real human nature or will is heretical but like to be bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox clh

from kilroy gboro rowan edu dr nancy sweetie subject certainty and arrogance organization rowan college of new jersey lines dean velasco quoted letter from james stowell president of moody bible institute the other day was at the dry cleaner and the radio was playing it caught my attention because talk show guest was criticizing evangelical christians saying we believe in absolutes and think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are we affirm the absolutes of scripture not because we are arrogant moralists but because we believe in god who is truth who has revealed his truth in his word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance of those absolutes there has been lot of discussion but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at the arrogance being attacked is that we think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are in short many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts in particular the problem is one of epistemology as shorthand you can think of epistemology as how do you know that question it turns out is very troubling one the problem with absolute certainty is that at the bottom at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible the reasoning you did to discover source of truth is in question and that means you do not have absolute justification for your source of authority which means you do not have absolute certainty let take the specific example of biblical inerrancy and fictional inerrantist named zeke the following arguments applies to the idea of papal infallibility too zeke has we presume spent some time studying the bible and history and several other topics he has concluded based on all these studies and possibly some religious experiences that the bible is source of absolute truth he may be correct but even if he is he cannot be certain that he is correct his conclusion depends on how well he studied history he may have made mistakes and the references he used may have contained mistakes his conclusion depends on how well he studied the bible he may have made mistakes his conclusion depends on his own reasoning and he may have made mistakes noticing common thread yet everything about his study of the world that he did everything that happened in his own head is limited by his own thinking no matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes he can never be certain of his own infallibility as long as any part of the belief is based on his own reasoning that belief cannot be considered absolutely certain zeke believes that he has found source of absolute truth but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless his conclusions are in doubt any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking there is no way out of the loop only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs this is easy to demonstrate let go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology how do you know imagine hypothetical discussion the bible is source of absolute truth how do you know studied history and the bible and religious writings and church teachings and came to this conclusion how do you know you studied history correctly well double checked everything how do you know you double checked correctly well compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed just because some smart guy believes something that doesn mean it is true how do you know they studied it correctly and as you see will eventually get to the point where he has to say can prove that there are no mistakes and as long as you may have made mistake then you cannot be absolutely certain there is no way out of the loop this is where the arrogance of christians arises many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible and that there is no possibility of mistake claiming that you cannot have made mistake and that your thinking has led you to flawless conclusion is pretty arrogant people who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find infallibility of the church_ by george salmon he is attacking the idea that the pope can be knowably infallible and he does so very well but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the bible is knowably inerrant darren provine kilroy gboro rowan edu at the core of all well founded belief lies belief that is unfounded ludwig wittgenstein

from jemurray magnus acs ohio state edu john murray subject quality of catholic liturgy organization the ohio state university lines would like the opinion of netters on subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass it driving me crazy the most grace filled aspect of liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we do together because we all know how to do it led by the priest of course which makes it kind of dialogue we present to god but the best masses ve been to were participatory prayers lately think the proportion of participation has fallen and the proportion of sitting there and watching or listening or generally being told what to do which is necessary because no one knows what happening next is growing example last sunday palm sunday we went to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion taking the role of the mob the theology behind this seems profound when we say crucify him we mean it we did it and if he came back today we do it again it always gives me chills but last week we were invited to sit during the gospel passion and besides the orwellian invitation was really saddened to have my and our little role taken away this seems typical of shift of participation away from the people and toward the musicians readers and so on new things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what happening the new things have to be explained and pretty soon instead of lot of the mass we re just sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the mass is about to be done in my mind lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts but that may not be just do think that liturgy committee has bias toward doing something rather than nothing that just fact of bureaucratic life even though simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the lord presence so we ve been wondering are we the oddballs or is the quality of the mass going down don mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or friday and are reminded of the power of very simple liturgy to make us aware of god presence but as far as the obligatory sunday masses maybe should just offer it up has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in catholic masses lately john murray

from kilroy gboro rowan edu dr nancy sweetie subject re certainty and arrogance organization rowan college of new jersey lines in an earlier article explained that what many people find arrogant about christians is that some christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines that is many christians insist that they cannot have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs which amounts to saying that they are infallible impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant most of us will probably agree in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect so long as your own brain is involved there is possibility for error summarised the problem by writing there is no way out of the loop someone called rexlex has claimed that there is way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism as have explained to him before you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads the facts do not change just because you dislike them rexlex wrote disagree with dr nancy sweetie conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair however as any first year philosophy student can explain what rexlex has written does not constitute refutation all he has said is that he does not like what wrote he has done nothing at all to dispute it there were two sentences in rexlex post that seemed relevant to the point at hand there is such thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced and it is verifiable do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience have for example direct experience of adding numbers don claim to be infallible at it in fact remember doing sums incorrectly but do claim that have direct experience of reasoning about numbers however once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them we are on much shakier ground that was the point of the earlier article human brains are infested with sin and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances it is only because of god own revelation that we can be absolute about thing but how far does that get you once god revelation stops and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears for example let suppose that our modern bible translations include perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper and that jesus said exactly this is my body we ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true what can we be certain of not much at the moment he stops speaking and people start interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean that literally or not we do not have any record that he elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con substatiation he didn say we interpret this passage using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions but we know that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong this is something that most of us have direct experience of why should anyone believe that his reasoning which he knows to be fallible can lead him to perfect conclusions so given the assumptions in this example what we can be certain of is that jesus said this is my body beyond that once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what christ revealed we get into trouble unless you are infallible there are very few things you can be certain of to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking they cannot be certain that is the problem of seeming arrogant the non christians around us know that human beings make mistakes just as surely as we know it they do not believe we are infallible any more than we do when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying to cover them up think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only very

is reply to one of the letters seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell there nothing like preacher to put fear into an ignorant man if god hadn created hell in the first place there be no no need to die and save us isn it also bit paradoxical to say god died when in fact no such thing is remotely possible can the infinite die your using th century concepts to interprete st century writers of course in your termonology god could not cease to exist however that is not what death ever means in the scriptures if you will study the word you will see that it signifies separation death is separation not ceastation this is the reason for the agony of the cross for the first time in eternity one member of the godhead was separated from the other two once met young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived she was as personable as any saint ever imagined she was to become my girlfriend for several years however having been drafted we were separated by distance to me that was form of death later she decided that she couldn wait for me to come home and bid me adue that to me was death it was separation from that which had made me whole death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from his fellowship not because he chose to send you into outer darkness but because you chose to go there did you know that jesus talked more about hell than he did about heaven thank you for this info what respect had for the man now has been diminished tenfold promise never again to say how wise or loving this man was when rebelled against my earthly father he spanked me found no wisdom in that until had grown older and especially until had my own children he was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if continued on my suicidal course he did it in love though interpreted it as harsh and unloving if god warns of impending danger that is love if choose to let us do as we please and then at the end tell us the rules that would be harsh you have conscience no matter how calused or fallen it is that witnesses to you that thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear being jesus was allegedly god doubt he could honestly feel the pinpricks man dealt him this may give light to the error of your understanding one must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith faith and knowledge are inseparable jesus most certainly felt the pinpricks of life as the scripture say heb for we do not have high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin the kenosis passage of phil states that he gave up his godhead attributes when he took upon himself humanity it has been favorite meditation of mine to think about this it was to be my phd thesis the consciousness of christ have talked at length with great many people about this interesting study including clh it is my conclussion that as jesus the nd member of the trinity actually suffered as we do he became part of the human race and experienced it as we do he grew in knowledge he chose not to grasp his omniscience but chose to be taught it is my understanding that he was led of the spirit to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between jesus the man and jesus as god but in jn where the adulterous women was thrown before him the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took him by surprise that is he was not aware that this event was to take place in time he was living sequential history as you or maybe some other time we can discuss this but it is very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not thanks again for the info just so you know some friends and are starting freethinkers organization and going to use some of the info you provided for an organization intro duction was once member of that club the free thinker is glorious ideal by contrast of course you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic inhibited reactionary and repressive find such stance to be as amusing as it is absurd if the liberal humanist wishes to criticize christian or buddhist or marxist that is his right but what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rational doubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith he must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as free thinker to criticize the christian it might equally be rational doubt for the christian to criticize him as humanist if there is no faith there can be no dout there is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith pascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive few speak dubiously of scepticism the fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else the person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths will be the devoted adherent of another in fact it is measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms hence the term theist some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism in my campus ministry ran across this more times than care to remember however they disproved their own argument with every thought every word every point of logic that they used every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent that is to say that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary next time you re in room of skeptics yell out look your fly is undone each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism to stress this is to belabor the obvious but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows pure objectivism is myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity the answer to this impasse lies in rd way of knowing one which is based on presuppositions but if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral in other words another myth presuppositions my friend it is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt our own assumptions presuppostions even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence tell you what if god condemns me for being honest he is unworthy of my worship better to burn in hell than to serve tyrant in heaven of course that is hardly an original statement milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia it was even used in the first highlander movie but again your presuption is based on faulty knowledge of the character of god you are operating off of premise of humanistic theology not what he has revealed of himself through history through his prophets through his word and lastly but most of all thru his son if you are to reject god annointed savior then reject him from correct understanding of himself rex

from ejalbert husc harvard edu subject re monophysites and mike walker organization harvard university science center lines in article may geneva rutgers edu db andrew cmu edu andrew byler writes mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity it consequence of the fall jesus is human but not fallen human clh differ with our moderator on this thought the whole idea of god coming down to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death as one of the consecration prayers in the book of common prayer puts it was that jesus was tempted but did not succumb if sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity then jesus fully human nicea would not be subject to sin but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin to distinguish between human and fallen human makes jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology don think there any question that there is problem with nestorius and would agree that the saying christ had human form without real human nature or will is heretical but like to be bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox clh first the monophysites inherited none of nestorius version they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him second the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not as extreme as his successful opponents who wrote the conventional history claimed mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary arguing think correctly that human could not be called mother of god mean in the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreate surely even arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary anyway nestorius opponents claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus which would require two seperate and distinct natures the argument fails though because mary simply gave birth to jesus who preexisted her either divinely if you accept nestorianism as commonly defined or both natures intertwined la chalcedon second am not sure that nestorianism is not better alternative than the orthodox view after all find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus human nature was in heaven likewise post ascension think rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him it was seperate nature capable of being tempted as in gethsemane since believe the divine nature could never be tempted but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed comments on the above warmly appreciated jason albert there may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin the original complaint was from someone who didn see how we could call jesus fully human because he didn sin completely agree that jesus was subject to temptation simply object to the idea that by not succumbing he is thereby not fully human believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism agree with you and have said elsewhere that there reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was not nestorian have to confess that the first time read some of the correspondence between nestorius and his opponents thought he got the better of them however most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to chalcedon was an advance and that nestorius was at the very least rash and dogmatic as the editor of the christological controversy refers to him in rejecting all approaches other than his own as regular usenet readers know narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong furthermore he did say some things that think are problematical he responds to rather mild letter from cyril with flame worthy of usenet in it he says to attribute also to the logos in the name of the incarnation the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him is my brother either the work of mind which truly errs in the fashion of the greeks or that of mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and apollinaris and the others those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound because of it to make the divine logos have part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness these things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood it all well and good to maintain proper distinction between humanity and divinity but the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have to some degree part in being born growing up and dying of course it must be understood that there certain indirectness in the logos participation in these things but there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human or we don have an incarnation at all nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area you say find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus human nature was in heaven don think that required by orthodox doctrine it the divine logos that is eternal clh

from jhpb sarto budd lake nj us joseph buehler subject re sspx schism organization none lines here is some material by michael davies on the subject of schism in general and archishop lefebvre in particular he wrote it around the first part of the two part article was on the scandalous activities of archbishop weakland in this country but cut all that and pared down the rest to what was relevant joe buehler schism and disobedience according to st thomas aquinas schism consists primarily in refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the members of the church united to him on first sight it would appear that whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop as discussed above he must be in state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the pope on very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction however standard catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic if this were so as was noted at the beginning of this article it would mean that the number of american bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures the distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique the article is by father yves congar who is certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre he explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused father congar writes that schism involves refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church for example luther rejection of the papacy father congar explains that the refusal to accept decision of legitimate authority in particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience the catholic encyclopedia explains that for catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend to sever himself from the church as far as in him lies it adds that not every disobedience is schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors denial of their divine right to command not only does mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the pope authority and his intention of never breaking away from rome the archbishop made his attitude clear in the july august issue of days we pray for the pope every day nothing has changed with the consecrations last june we are not sedevacantists we recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the catholic church we don even say that he is heretical pope we only say that his modernist actions favor heresy intrinsically schismatic the principal argument used by those claiming that mgr lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of bishop without papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act bishop who carries out such consecration it is claimed becomes ipso facto schismatic this is not true if such consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication in the code of canon law the offence was punished only by suspension see canon of the code pope pius xii had raised the penalty to excommunication as response to the establishment of schismatic church in china the consecration of these illicit chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the pope that is to deny that he has the right to govern the church and the illicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given mandate to exercise an apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction they have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr lefebvre the consecration of bishops without papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman pontiff but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the church could not be more grave and that grave measures were needed in response it appears to be taken for granted by most of the archbishop critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism and the vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression there is not so much as modicum of truth in this allegation the new code of canon law includes section beginning with canon entitled penalties for specific offenses de poenis in singula dicta the first part deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the church de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem canon deals with the offense of schism which is evidently together with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the church but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or indeed under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church the canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of penalties for specific offenses which is entitled usurpation of ecclesial functions and offenses in their exercise de munerum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis the canon in question is canon which reads bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such consecration from bishop without pontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the holy see the scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism are then contrary to both truth and charity comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages an accurate parallel would be to state that man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder must stress that what have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of canon law canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable father patrick yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris noted in the july issue of valeurs actuelles that as have just explained mgr lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function he added that it is not the consecration of bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop it is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing parallel church cardinal rosalio lara president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law commented on the consecrations in the july issue of la repubblica it would be hard to imagine more authoritative opinion the cardinal wrote the act of consecrating bishop without papal mandate is not in itself schismatic act in fact the code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections one deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the church and these are apostasy schism and heresy consecrating bishop with pontifical mandate is on the contrary an offense against the exercise of specific ministry for example in the case of the consecrations carried out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc in and although the archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed schismatic act because there was no intention of breach with the church it is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least intent of establishing schismatic church he is not schismatic and will never be schismatic the archbishop considers correctly that the the church is undergoing its worst crisis since the arian heresy and that for the good of the church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his society canon law provides for just such situation and even if one believes that the future of the society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means as canon law states clearly that he has not incurred excommunication furthermore while the vatican allows such prelates as archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it cannot expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the church and the salvation of souls dr eric de saventhem president of the international una voce association is one of the best informed laymen in the church and he knows the archbishop intimately dr de saventhem like myself has no greater desire than to see reconciliation between mgr lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop lifetime quotation from statement by dr de saventhem which was published in the february remnant merits careful study in retrospect the road leading to the consecrations of june appears more paved with grave roman and unfortunately also papal omissions than with lefebvrist obstinancies and from the eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to present the archbishop act of grave disobedience as an offense against the faith it is said today that mgr lefebvre has an erroneous concept of tradition if this were so cardinal ratzinger could not on behalf of the pope have addressed to the archbishop the following words in his letter of july your ardent desire to safeguard tradition by procuring for it the means to live and prosper testifies to your attachment to the faith of all time the holy father understands your concern and shares it

from nabil cae wisc edu nabil ayoub subject re monophysites and mike walker organization of wisconsin madison college of engineering lines hello src readers again the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox churches believe in monophysitism pops up again we had discussion about it while ago in article may geneva rutgers edu db andrew cmu edu andrew byler writes the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism this was heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox then ofm comments these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology don think there any question that there is problem with nestorius and would agree that the saying christ had human form without real human nature or will is heretical but like to be bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought with my appreciation to the moderator believe that further elaboration is needed this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the copt net newsletter under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople as opposed to the western empire of rome the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played leading roles in christian theology they were invited everywhere to speak about the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandria was the head of the ecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year it was said that the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend all their time in meetings this leading role however did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with church affairs it all started when the emperor marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church the response of st dioscorus the pope of alexandria who was later exiled to this interference was clear you have nothing to do with the church these political motives became even more apparent in chalcedon in when the coptic church was unfairly accused of following the teachings of eutyches who believed in monophysitism this doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ has only one nature the divine not two natures the human as well as the divine the coptic church has never believed in monophysitism the way it was portrayed in the council of chalcedon in that council monophysitism meant believing in one nature copts believe that the lord is perfect in his divinity and he is perfect in his humanity but his divinity and his humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate word which was reiterated by st cyril of alexandria copts thus believe in two natures human and divine that are united in one without mingling without confusion and without alteration from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy these two natures did not separate for moment or the twinkling of an eye also from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy the coptic church was misunderstood in the th century at the council of chalcedon perhaps the council understood the church correctly but they wanted to exile the church to isolate it and to abolish the egyptian independent pope despite all of this the coptic church has remained very strict and steadfast in its faith whether it was conspiracy from the western churches to exile the coptic church as punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced or whether pope dioscurus didn quite go the extra mile to make the point that copts are not monophysite the coptic church has always felt mandate to reconcile semantic differences between all christian churches this is aptly expressed by the current th successor of st mark pope shenouda iii to the coptic church faith is more important than anything and others must know that semantics and terminology are of little importance to us throughout this century the coptic church has played an important role in the ecumenical movement the coptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches it has remained member of that council since the coptic church is member of the all african council of churches aacc and the middle east council of churches mecc the church plays an important role in the christian movement by conducting dialogues aiming at resolving the theological differences with the catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and evangelical churches as final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitism was condemned so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in monophysitism peace nabil nabil ayoub engine research center dept of mechanical engineering university of wisconsin madison email ayoub erctitan me wisc edu as mentioned in brief apology the comment quoted above from me is confused appear to say that nestorius was monophysite as andrew byler correctly stated it the nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties the point was making which nabil explains in some detail is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren chalcedon was compromise between two groups the alexandrians and antiochenes it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes agree that there were extremes that were heretical however in the course of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got rejected who didn intend heresy but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented and some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine there are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps this posting discussed the descendants of the

from kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko subject re atheist views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart organization university of oulu finland lines first thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions in my follow up to jason smith posting will address some issues that have caused jason smith jasons atlastele com wrote in article apr athos rutgers edu kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko writes also concede that was doubly remiss as asserted no reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist also understand that proving theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes likely description of the phenomena in question am mistaken with this understanding yes to some degree there was an excellent discussion in sci skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago hope it did not escape your notice the correct word is likely there is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct theories are backed up by evidence but not proved no theory can be true in mathematical sense however theories are not mere descriptions or of phenomena it is extremely important to test whether theories can something new or not yet observed all successful theories science has come up with have passed this test including the big bang theory of cosmic evolution the theory of natural selection etc it does not mean they be correct but they are not mere best fits for the data but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith well yes if you want to in them this is not what science requires take good look at the theory and the evidence see if the theory has made any successful predictions and use your reason disbelievers are not punished the fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive with out conclusive evidence we are left with faith this is what puzzles me why do we need to have faith in my fellow atheists would call me weak atheist someone who is unable to believe ie fails to entertain any belief in god yes know that one can believe without god help luther makes this quite clear in his letter to erasmus afraid this does not change my situation couple of paragraphs deleted summary we ask why does the universe exist think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing deletions the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don exist don exist tautology at its best carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first asks why while the second is request for definition no it is not although it does look like one this is true dichotomy either something exists or nothing exists if nothing exists nobody would ask why if something exists it is possible to ask why but actually no existing being could give an answer imagine for moment that the nobodies in non existence could also ask why nothing exists this is equivalent to my counter question why nothing exists in nothingness now why anything exists is equivalent to why something exists in somethingness is what meant with my tautology my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post might add the worldview of things that exist do and things that don don is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist belief in god it is based on the assumption that there is not reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being reason its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is reason do indeed think there probably no reason for being or existence in general for reasons stated above however they will still leave open the question why this and not that and this is where theistic explanations come in science cannot give reasons for any human being existence we come to this either am therefore am or am for reason this is deep philosophical question is determinism true or not also is god deterministic or not tend to think this question has no meaning in his case if am for reason ve yet failed to see what it would be from our perspective it looks like exist for truly random reasons just rolled two dice why did get and how can believe there is any better reason for my existence if the former is satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not doctor if the latter your search is just beginning yes am satisfied with this reason until find something better my years of christianity were of no help in this respect have to admit but am patient another answer is that god is the of all existence this sounds much better but am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this does not preclude his existence it only seeks to identify his qualities implying he exists to have qualities btw no it doesn but think an existing god cannot know why he exists for an answer to this question is not knowable of course this should not be any obstacle to belief in his existence also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why it appears that pihko agrees as we shall see but because tool is inadequate to answer question does not preclude the question asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer it is impossible to know unknowable things however the question why do exist in particular is an invalid question this is not what said but from our perspective it is impossible to tell and can just believe in any given explanation instead of another especially since found was deluding myself my apologies was using why as why did this come to be why did pre existence become existence why did pre spacetime become spacetime think pre existence is an oxymoron there is no time outside of this spacetime except in some other universe and from that perspective our universe never was it exists only for those who are inside it but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why because it can be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid no the validity of the question has to be discussed separately think philosophy is of great help here what can be known and what is not knowable pihko does present good point though we may need to ask what do as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if new discovery truly disagrees with what god said and continues to say in his word this is very good question in trying to answer this and numerous other questions that bothered me finally found nothing to base my faith on think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves why do believe or why don

dleonar andy bgsu edu pixie writes deletia sig if you do sincerely believe that god exists why do you follow it blindly do the words question authority mean anything to you defy any theist to reply deletia formalities probably should let this pass it not worth the time and it not really intended for me but couldn resist personal weakness of mine jerkius kneeus tragically incurable the foundation for faith in god is reason without which the existence of god could not be proven that his existence can be proven by reason is indisputable cf my short treatise traditional proofs for the existence of god and summa theologica not so can prove that the existance of god is disputable by showing that people dispute it this is easy dispute that god exists simple missed your traditional proofs treatise but the proofs remember from the summa theologic the ways think it was were rather poor stuff the ontological argument is about billion times better imho would think you want non traditional proofs considering the general failure of the traditional proofs at least the ones know of am thinking of the ontological argument the cosmological argument and the teleological argument those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names anyway now given that god exists and that his existence can be proven by reason assert that his commands must be followed blindly although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith why this is the real question so to discuss it ll assume god exists otherwise there is no heavenly authority to babble about because god is the first cause of all things the first mover of matter the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence the measure of all that is perfect and the essential being who gives order to the universe logos please show this is the case am familiar with the first cause argument and ll accept for the sake of argument that there is first cause even though find some of its premices questionable the rest you ll have to show this includes that the first cause is god next assert that god is all good got it deny that god is all good so there if this is so then that which is contrary to the will of god is evil the absence of the good and since god can never contradict himself then by his promise of savior as early as the protoevangelium of genesis god instructs that because human adam was first responsible for man alienation from the source of all good man would be required to act to restore the friendship thus god became incarnate in the person of the messiah this isn self consistent if humans must renew the relationship then god incarnate or not can do it well unless you think god is human granted god made himself human but this is nonetheless cheating the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused god fixing it even by indirect means contradicts this now this messiah claimed that he is the truth john if this claim is true then we are bound by reason to follow him who is truth incarnate why also why assume said claim is true anyway if claim to be truth are you bound by reason to follow me you next seem to have problem with authority have you tried the united states marine corps yet can tell you first hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority undoubtably do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the marines without question you seem to imply this about god and that the marines are similar in this respect if this is not what you are trying to say they please explain what it is you are saying as have missed it if you have not yet had the privilege will reply that the authority which is truth incarnate may never be questioned and thus must be followed blindly why why not question it even if it is truth we cannot know this certainly so why is it so irrational to question perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong you assert that god is truth and we can question truth but assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth how is it my assertion is less good than yours one may not deny the truth oh hereby deny hope you ll agree is the truth granted look pretty damn silly saying something like that but needed something we both agree was clearly true now you ll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag no heaven lighting bolts either no mysterious net outages seem to be permited to say such things absurd or not for example when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newton head he could have denied that it happened but he did not the laws of physics must be obeyed whether human likes them or not they are true they are certainly not true at least the ones newton derived are not true and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances we do not have set of laws of physics that always works in all cases if we did physics would be over already science is all about questioning this sort of truth if we didn we still follow aristotle generalize this little more if you want to learn anything new you must question the things you know tm because you can always be wrong therefore the authority which is truth may not be denied even presupposing that truth may not be denied and may not be questioned and that god is truth it only follows that god may not be denied or questioned not that he must be obeyed we could unquestioningly disobey him how annoying of us but you have not connected denial with disobedience dan no nickname johnson and god said jeeze this is dull and it was dull genesis these opinions probably show what know

from qtm virginia edu quinn mccord subject questions from newbie organization university of virginia lines is life pass fail course and does god grade on curve new here and only vaguely religious but want to know what some of you people think specifically are there an infinite number of heavens and person goes to the one that he she deserves or is it simply heaven or nothing hell also are we graded by those around us or has there always been some unchanging method is the person childhood taken into account sure these must sound like over simplifications to most of you but figure that you re the experts quinn eschatology is an area on which christians do not agree suspect that because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries and their writings tend to be highly symbolic however both jesus teachings in the gospels and books such as the revelation to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death on number of occasions jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation lk and number of similar passages where jesus says things like even xxx will be better off than you in the judgement also cor talks about someone who gets into heaven but by the skin of his teeth as it were but these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell and not all christians would even go as far as that the only christian group know of that believes in multiple heavens is the mormons and they are very far from mainstream christianity far enough that many of our readers would not call them christian their ideas in this area involve specific mormon revelations in addition to the bible and holy tradition of more generic christian sort note that many christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with god the whole point of christ was to free us from the results of test that we couldn possibly pass if you like test analogies god grades on very strict and unbending scale but he also cheats he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher before actually doing the grading because some people end up in heaven and others in hell it easy to see why you be inclined to think of it as grading while there are differences among branches of christianity on details think we all agree that in one way or another god cheats am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far god cheating extends will he accept people who don explicitly acknowledge christ but somehow still follow him in their hearts many christians believe that this is possible at least in principle but certainly not all do jesus provided us with clear description of how to be saved but it not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he going to place the dividing line certainly he made it clear that we can expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not clh

from sun gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo subject re athiests and hell lines in article apr geneva rutgers edu rexlex fnal fnal gov writes in article apr geneva rutgers edu sun gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo writes note that in this perhaps the oldest of the creeds there is no mention of the danger of hell for non believers likewise there is no mention of the salvation of the believers soul and its destiny in heaven after death there is only the resurrection of the body and it does not say when or how you don go far enough back if we believe in god and that he did create the heavens and the earth and he did create adam and eve and that they walked in the garden and history flowed from there if we can agree with that then would you agree that the further back you go the closer you get to people who had stronger memory of who god was and what he said and commanded between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history the greek for example could say better beggar in the land of the living than king in the land of the dead iliad think the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians am not ready to conscign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation yet they all died in their sins in the christian sense the same can be said of the whole of gentile humanity and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him do not limit the power of christ to save even him through whom satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment in my studies of the ancient mystery reliegions have run across many poems or rituals or what nots with the interpretation that those who are of god will be with him via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer eternal life in dieing it was standard belief back then it is possible to experience eternity in passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time it is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss or even many of them in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and new birth it was also standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost this again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people ideas of life after death today we think we know so much and that if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people thing or two but think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from mist not those of the older ages mankind fell into mist and darkness and at the turning point of time new light entered into the world the light still grows and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under standing lies before us our new vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well at this point should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject have said it before love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would fall the history to purgatory can be shown from the druids in england to the greeks who pilaged it from the egyptians who ultimately got it from the babylonian mysteries and yes the eastern religions also show many similarities mean its black and white the writings and the archeological finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine the way you refer to it as doctrine puts modern intellectual coloring on it think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they were passed on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality in any case we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of euclid but by contemplating the principles themselves on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim maybe at sometime in the future indeed should also clarify that do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment after the end of single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out rex gerry compuserve com

from sun gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo subject re good jewish arguments lines kwfinken pooh harpo uccs edu kevin finkenbinder wrote scott born phys virginia edu wrote intro deleted jesus wasn really descended from david as the messiah was supposed to have been joseph was but christians say that joseph wasn related to jesus truthfully if you look at the geneology of christ in luke and the one in matthew you will notice that they trace different lines back to david have been told that one traces mary line back to david and the other traces joseph line back to david both of them go beyond david in history acording to some of my jewish friends jewishness is passed to child by the mother and the legal rights of jewishness are passed through the father if it is true that one of these geneologies is mary then christ bloodline is from david through his mother this also means that christ had all of the legal rights of decendant of david as according to at least roman law and possibly mosaic law as well but am not sure joseph was christ legal father the argument for luke genealogy being that of mary is very weak according to luke and when he began his ministry jesus himself was about thirty years of age being supposedly the son of joseph the son of eli aside from the fact that mary is not mentioned there are two possible interpretations either joseph was her father or he was her brother clearly this is not acceptable third would be that joseph the son of eli was her father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed but that would seem to be grasping at straws the most straightforward interpretation is that luke had no intention of tracing mary genealogy in which case he would have named her but that he traces her husband from david son nathan the matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from david son solomon to joseph matthew reads and to jacob was born joseph the husband of mary by whom was born jesus who is called christ there are two apparent problems the first is how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies which diverge with the sons of david solomon and nathan the second is why is any genealogy of joseph relavent at all if joseph had nothing to do with it if joseph was not jesus physical father then the original poster is quite correct that claims for jesus messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances whatever jesus divine nature was the second problem is easy in my mind we assume that joseph was not involved in the conception of jesus in any way however holy spirit capable of working physical conception in mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of joseph seed in this work in our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of physical act whereas it is really matter of purity on much higher level as well the important thing is that neither mary nor joseph was conscious of any union between them they had not known each other thus the first gospel dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of joseph is quite relevant to jesus the virgin birth not withstanding to the first question there is an answer that creates to begin with more problems than it resolves it is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents except for the names of the parents and the child and the birthplace in bethlehem there is no point in common between the two stories matthew and luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the baptism of jesus in jordan rudolf steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one jesus of nazareth he did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation or from other external documents and the discussion of how this could be might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup in any case the details are described in steiner the spiritual guidance of the human being and of humanity the gospel of st luke and the gospel of st matthew whether or not rudolf steiner methods and explanation are accepted as valid at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact as for the passing of one jewishness through the mother this was never an issue with jesus no one ever questioned his or mary jewishness the issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from david the king gerry palo compuserve com

from pharvey quack kfu com paul harvey subject re sabbath admissions of organization the duck pond public unix log in as guest lines wrote in response to dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius_lecointe it not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq think paul comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said was paul god too is an interpretation of the words of paul of higher priority than the direct word of jesus in matt paul begins romans with if someone is weak in the faith do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord yes but what does the bible have to say what did jesus say paul closes romans with on the other hand the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty because he isn acting on his faith and any failure to act on faith is sin gaus isbn have you read the ten commandments which are portion of the law have you read jesus word in matt is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin greek hamartia missing the mark however like to be clear that do not think there unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited whereas the ten commandments and jesus words in matt are fairly clear are they not the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question matt doesn answer your question what day christians met in their houses acts despite darius confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday it doesn say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread breaking bread roughly synonymous with eating so think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship how do you unite this concept of yours with the ten commandments and jesus word in matt think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh or they assumed that the ten commandments and jesus word in matt actually stood for something perhaps they were strong in the faith no don believe that paul can overrule god however paul was writing for largely gentile audience the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called noachic laws but they are quite minimal the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didn say that the law was abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn apply to gentiles thus there is no contradiction with mat as far as can tell both paul and other jewish christians did continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thus they continued to obey the law the issue was and is with gentile christians who are not covered by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it jesus dealt mostly with jews think we can reasonably assume that mat was directed to jewish audience he did interact with gentiles few times the centurion whose slave was healed and couple of others the terms used to describe the centurion see luke suggest that he was god fearer gentile who followed god but had not adopted the whole jewish law he was commended by jewish elders as worthy person and jesus accepted him as such this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view that gentiles need not accept the law however there more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law in order to get full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with paul apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least as read paul he says that the law serves purpose that has been in certain sense superceded again this issue isn one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that not what he intends to say rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ paul comments are not the world clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin it important that it not be relaxed however for christians it not the end ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the end think jesus and paul come to rather similar conclusion the quoted passage from mat should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets the law the not an iota or dot would suggest rather literal reading but in fact that not jesus approach jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details indeed he is well known for taking rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher laws some scholars claim that mat needs to be taken in the context of st cent jewish discussions jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity mat this and the discussion later in mat suggest that jesus has very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it paul conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained believe they are talking about different aspects of the law paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision as is natural in letters responding to specific situations he looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewish ceremonies he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble it unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts look at the way terms like family values take on special meaning from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why family values should be used as code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the think law had taken on similar role in the arguments paul was involved in paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values that go along with the term law any more than people who concerned about the family values movement are really opposed to family values clh

from dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius_lecointe subject re sabbath admissions of organization florida state university lines someone sent me this faq by mail and post my response here not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because most of our readers probably haven seen it clh christ warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven matt this faq is so full of error that must respond to it hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology brothers and sisters being new to the faith and examining the decalogue closely ve noticed the fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the sabbath day it states the th day saturday is the sabbath while most christian religions keep or atleast go to church on sunday what up this is frequently asked question every time it arises it causes months of debate so let me see if can answer you directly basically it because the law was given to moses as part of specific covenanent with the jews most of us aren jews so we aren part of that covenant there was an argument early in christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply to gentiles who became christians you can see the account of this debate in acts the main question there was circumcision but keeping the sabbath would be part of it as well the apostles concluded that we need not become jews in order to become christians and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai rom notes that where no law is there is no transgression not only did sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai ex the problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded it god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people but in their ignorance after years of slavery they promised what ever he says to do we will do that is why the new covenant is based on better promises heb rather than do away with the law god promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts heb including the sabbath in the acts is selective inclusion the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was added because of transgression of the moral law gal israel stands for god people of all time that is why god grafted the gentiles in roma says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of god and the promises belong to israelites in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough for they are not all israel which are of israel then in gal he says if ye be christ then are ye abraham seed and heirs according to the promise all christians are abraham seed jews israelites not physically for that is not the criterion but spiritually we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites while christians agree that the ot laws do not all apply to us because some of them are part of specific covenanent with the jews we also expect to see some similarity between the things god expected from the jews and the things he expects from us after all it the same god however there are several ways of dealing with this these days the most common approach is to separate the ot commandments into moral and ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply only to the jews they are part of the specific mosaic covenant these are thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision moral laws apply to everyone most of the commands are part of the moral law except for the commandment about the sabbath believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but general obligation to worship regularly is part of the general moral law thus christians are free to choose the specific time we worship people would probably agree but they are wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of law which predates the ceremonial laws you are not free to choose your time of worship even if you were why do you follow day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship would you rather give up day which god blessed sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see sabbath admissions in soc religion christian bible study more radical approach which is generally connected with john calvin and the reformed tradition says that the law as whole is no longer binding instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior should be guided solely by love portions of the ot law are still useful as guidance but they are not properly speaking legally binding on us in practice most people who take this position do not believe it is safe to leave christians without moral guidannce while we may no longer be under law as sinners it not safe for us to go into situations with no principles to guide us we re too good at self justification for that to be safe thus christians do have moral guidance from things like jesus teachings paul advice etc these may not be precisely law but they serve much the same function as and have largely the same content as the moral law in the previous analysis while calvin would deny that we have fixed legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is important do not care what calvin or any theologian says my guide is what god says if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment which is the only one god thought was important enough to say remember if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god if cop pulls me over for speeding then in court ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace do walk out of the court saying can now go on speeding for am now under grace being under grace now drive within the speed limit paul adds to it in rom di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good rom in both analyses the specific day is not an issue as matter of tradition we worship on sunday as memorial of christ resurrection there some debate about what acts shows about early christian worship the most common analysis is that is shows jewish christians continuing to go to jewish services on the sabbath but that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then act shows worship on the first day sunday and cor also implies gatherings on that day there are few groups that continue to believe christians have to worship on the sabbath saturday the best known are the seventh day adventists and jehovah witnesses they argue that act is not regular worship service but special meeting to see paul off and that cor doesn explicitly say it regular worship service do you prefer implication to fact careful study of the acts shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to worship service but set off on long journey by foot to assos in icor there is no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to worship service it clear that this issue was contested one in paul time see rom paul advice is that we should be very careful about judging each other on issues like this one person sees specific day as mandated by god while another does not he who observes that specific day does it in honor of the lord he who believes his worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the lord those who believe that the sabbath is still mandated argue that paul is not referring to sabbath worship here note however col which says something similar but briefer it explicitly mentions sabbath wrong these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the sabbath day of the moral law there are some differences among christians about use of the word sabbath originally the term referred to the th day the jewish day of worship many christians now use it to refer to sunday the day of christian worship they do this largely so that they can apply the th or whatever there are couple of different numbering schemes commandment to it reformed tradition does not do this it distinguishes between the sabbath which is the observance mandated for jews and the lord day which is the free christian worship the only reference can find to this in the nt is rev there are also differences about laws regarding this day many christians support blue laws both in secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people to spend it in worship the more radical anti legal approach sees such regulations as return to the jewish sabbath which is not appropriate to the free christian worship of the lord day why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey simple request from god who loved you enough to die for you jesus died because the law could not be changed why bother to die in order to meet the demands of broken law if all you need to do is change the law penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws it will always be sin to make false gods to violate god name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagree but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god darius it not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq think paul comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord however like to be clear that do not think there unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question act describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath acts is an example of christians participating in them unfortunately it doesn tell us what day christians met in their houses acts despite darius confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the biblical text is clear about what was meant the wording implies to me that this was normal meeting it doesn say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread paul talked about his upcoming travel but that just not explicit enough to be really convincing similarly with cor it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul collection now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes can disprove it but the obvious time for congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention specific day so think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh
from news cbnewsk att com subject re what was the immaculate conception organization at bell labs lines in article may athos rutgers edu todd nickel laurentian ca writes your roommate is correct the immaculate conception refers to the conception of mary in her mother womb okay now that we ve defined the immaculate conception doctrine would it be possible for those more knowledgeable in the area to give the biblically or other support for it ve attempted to come to terms with it previously in an attempt to understand it for learning purposes and haven been able to grasp the reasoning it was gift from god think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the church held that mary was also without sin as was jesus as the tenets of faith developed particularly with augustine sin was more and more equated with sex and thus mary was assumed to be virgin for life since she never sinned and since she was the spouse of god etc since we also had this notion of original sin ie that man is born with predisposition to sin and since mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin she didn have original sin when science discovered the process of conception the next step was to assume that mary was conceived without original sin the immaculate conception mary at that time appeared to girl named bernadette at lourdes she refered to herself as the immaculate conception since nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine rcs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources that being sacred scripture and holy tradition in this case mostly tradition joe moore

there was no note do not know if it was someone idea of an innocent joke that went awry someone sick idea of flirting an act of emotional terrorism that worked dreaded coming back to work today what

generally have bible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if open it up to corinthians and find picture la the north american man boy love association want to throw up just thinking about this stuff can lock up my desk but can lock up every book have in the office can trust that someone won shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when not looking so that go home to find such picture or threat or raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body to make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch the appointed hour for leaving was was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch so returned at only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch they left at or so no one could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my number was posted so came back to department that looked like neutron bomb had gone off and was the sole survivor this despite the fact that everyone knew how bad felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer need some prayers can stop crying am so deeply wounded that it ridiculous feel like some kind of sub human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act feel like sub human piece of garbage that not worthy of simple phone call saying we re leaving for mary lunch little early so that bob can get back for big meeting please pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculously turned into something positive please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop and find some healing for him or herself please pray for my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of whole slew of other wounds please pray that can find new job in place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions this company in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene or threatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seven times in eight years in the same place pretty words from the company do me no good when terrified or healing from the latest assault and please pray that don turn into an automaton because of this that my bad habit ignore it and it will go away you re not worth anyone time so don go talking to anyone about this you re right you are sub human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way you are just an object you prostitute your mind to this company so why can others expect you to prostitute your body there as well what makes you think women aren just possessions and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act this is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into major depressive episode please pray that these thoughts don come into my head and stay there triggering depression please pray that this latest trauma doesn come between me and god in way wound like this is an invitation to deeper connection to god and it also possible trigger for spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from god know god doesn drop me from his loving hand but it awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand

from halsall murray fordham edu paul halsall subject catholic liturgy reply to halsall murray fordham edu organization random misconfigured site lines the problems with catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time the problem is in nutshell this the liturgy is symbolic action in other words catholics do or should believe that the during the mass water blessings vestments altar relics etc are real that is the sprinkling of water bestows real almost tangible holiness the vestments are real indication of real sacred time the point of is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying real referent this kind of thinking precludes analysis holy water is not holy because of anything it simply is holy but modern westerners find it extremely difficult especially if well educated to think of the mass as symbol we are more likely to see it as ie an action that represents grace but which could be replaced with other signs in concrete terms this means the mass has become commercial for god grace rather than the real thing you can mess around with commercial in way you wouldn dare with the real thing ask coca cola co these attitudes have been encouraged by liturgy workshops etc which instead of focusing on to do do liturgy have focused on how to create meaning in liturgy you can only create signs symbols have to come from god or the heart or somewhere deeper than analysis the most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species the consecrated host and wine now with pita bread etc it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles if the host is sign of grace this isnt and issue but catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of jesus body modern catholic liturgy is caught in this epistemological shift we try to perfrom the old rites but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and explain what we are doing so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it this is not soul filling experience it doesn help btw that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz folk music again result of mis analysis complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones this was the genius of wesley and the anglican hymn writers taize is only slightly better what are we to do well suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn work for you search out church where the liturgy is well prepared not well explained they exist in every city this is not btw matter of particular style the music might be old or new it is the attitude of the church that counts also note that conservative liturgy harking back to pre vatican ii days does not necessarily mean the church will be socially conservative in nyc can recommend corpus christi st st corpus christi st st very conservative liturgy st joseph greenwich village modern clean largely gay oratorian church brooklyn very beautiful avoid anywhere anytime church with electric candles happy easter christos aneste christos voskrezhne christ is risen paul halsall halsall murray fordham edu
from jhpb sarto budd lake nj us joseph buehler subject re sspx schism organization none lines in article apr geneva rutgers edu shellgate llo uu psi com larry overacker writes you ask where we are would echo that question not trying to be contentious but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions what prevents me from choosing any doctrine like and saying that papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time this is especially true since councils of bishops have basically stood by the pope the ultimate question is the traditional theology of the church this is the only thing that it is possible to resist pope for his departure from the traditional doctrine of the church if commands from any authority conflict with tradition the commands must be disobeyed my own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in major way god would never allow hair splitting situation to develop it would be too complex for people to figure out don view the present situation in the church as anything extremely complicated run through list of what has happened in the last years in the catholic church and any impartial observer will be aghast it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline the problems stem from general widespread ignorance of the catholic faith in my opinion most catholics know about zilch about the catholic faith this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops it basically the reformation part ii there is not even question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the catholic church are currently being trampled upon by the catholic hierarchy could go on listing shocking things for an hour probably take the situation in campos brazil for example reading book on what happened there after vatican council ii the bishop antonio de castro mayer never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of vatican ii he kept the traditional mass the same old catechisms etc he made sure the people knew their faith the catholic theology of obedience what modernism was etc he innoculated the people against what was coming well one day the order came from rome for his retirement it came when the pope was sick bishop de castro mayer waited until the pope recovered then inquired whether this command was what the pope really wanted or something that some liberal had commanded in his absence the pope confirmed the decision so the good bishop retired the injustice that followed was completely incredible new bishop was installed he proceeded to expel most of bishop de castro mayer clergy from their churches because they refused to celebrate the new mass the new bishop would visit parish and celebrate new mass the people would promptly walk out of the church en masse the bishop was enraged by this he usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church the priests would just start building new churches the people were completely behind them the old parishes had the new mass as the bishop desired and virtually no parishioners the prime motivation for all this was completely illegal according to canon law no priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional mass because of legislation enacted by pope saint pius nor is there any obligation to say the new mass during all this process the people of campos not just private individuals but including civil authorities were constantly sending petitions and letters to rome to do something about the new modernist bishop nothing was ever done no help ever arrived from rome eventually priests were kicked out and about people my question to the supporters of sspx is this is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the pope assuming that the pope position does not change and that the leaders of sspx don jointly make such choice if not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority if adopt the view that not wrong can be wrong and there no way ll change my mind you must change yours that ve either left the catholic church or it has left me if the pope defines certain things ex cathedra that would be the end of the controversy that process is all very well understood in catholic theology and anyone who doesn go along with it is an instant non catholic the problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the catholic world if they knew the faith and what our bishops are doing they would be shocked we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teaching of the church is if this were simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over years this isn the case in the catholic church there is massive body of traditional teaching the popes of the last years are especially relevant there is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term may be wrong here not roman catholic that heresy more or less although they have done great job since the reformation the last years have seen so many errors spread that it pitiful infallibility rests in the pope and in the church as whole in the short term pope or large sections of the church can go astray in fact that what usually happens during major heresy large sections of the church go astray the pope historically has been much more reliable everything will always come back in the long run what would be the effect of pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation would it be honored if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again not trying to be contentions trying to understand since orthodox ve got no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other yes it would be honored infallibility is infallibility but what is he going to define that the new mass is better expression of the catholic faith than the old that sex education in the catholic schools is wonderful that all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the popes prior to vatican ii it does if the command was legitimate sspx does not view the pope commands as legitimate why this is very slippery slope not really start studying the major catholic theologians of the last years everything is very well spelled out the west excels at critical thought remember that what catholic theologians have been busy at for centuries

for judgment before the white throne oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate they cried for the rock and the mountains they prayed but their prayers were too late the soul that had put off salvation not tonight ll get saved by and by no time now to think of religion alas he had found time to die and saw great white throne now some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation yet jesus thought it was paul thought it was paul said knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men today too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship we don tell people anymore that there such thing as sin or that there such place as hell as jayne has said this doesn mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with baseball bat yet the fact remains there is place called hell place so fearful that god died to save us from having to experience it whatever you or as christians do we should do whatever we can to win people to the lord if for no other reason to keep them from going to outer darkness jesus in mt tells us that he didn prepare hell for people he prepared it for the devil and his angels no where in the bible do read anywhere that god predestined anybody to go to hell moody use to say that the elect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wont whether or not that theologically sound couldn defend but its practical jesus said to the people of israel ye would not now some of you may not be students of the bible heck some of you may not be christians have you ever said to somebody don believe in hell believe in the religion of jesus but did you know that jesus talked more about hell than he did about heaven oh believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount you find hell taught by jesus in the sermon on the mount you ll read that jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire several times he talks about hell and about judgment in fact over and over in the synoptics matthew mark and luke jesus talks about hell not isaiah not moses not john the baptist though he did but jesus the son of god the great beloved one preached about hell because he loved people and didn want to see them go there now if there is no hell then jesus preached in vain it was our lord jesus not some angry baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies and where the fire never goes out jesus said that it was jesus who called hell furnace of fire it was jesus that used the word condemnation and this is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil jesus said that how can we get it across to you that loving dying jesus preached about hell not only that but he went through hell that what calgary was all about when my lord was on the cross darkness fell he called hell outer darkness do you have this idea that hell is place where the gamblers are gambling over here the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there that not what hell is hell not party there no fellowship there he called it outer darkness outer away from god darkness god is light no when he was on the cross he was made sin for you and for me god treated jesus the way sinners have to be treated that is sobering thought as my son would say an awesome thought my god my god why hast thou forsaken me hell is isolation there no fellowship in hell there no friendship in hell there no loving embrace in hell there no hand shake in hell there no word of encouragement in hell thirst it goes much deeper than physical thirst hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction the man whose life was lived for drugs will crave it eternally the man whose life was lived for the lust of woman body will crave it eternally and not be satisfied one theologian has put it this way and think it deserves merit what is hell hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost in recent post was trying to remember the founder of the word of life ministries ve remembered his name jack wertzen and found that the illustration that gave wasn his his illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to jack they sing these songs and read bible verses and their praising this and that can stand it jack do you think god would send me to hell jack answered by saying yes think he would of course the barber said what do you mean by that well if you can stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to god now what would you do in heaven where they ll do it for eternity you be miserable because god loves you he put you where it would match what you really are it makes man think the crucifixion of jesus christ is fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross he performed an eternal act don ask me how don know but he is god and he is the infinite eternal and when he died he died an infinite eternal death it is by that eternal act that he purchased eternal life for the whosoever wills he suffered eternal judgment lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying everybody is going to be saved eventually universalism my bible says no he ll separate them the sheep from the goats after you die there probationary period in which god prepares you for heaven no my bible says that it is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment some of the cultist believe in annihilation after you die sssswish just like mosquito you re squished out no in rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven don enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don enjoy listening to them but we have to preach the entire word of god there is place called hell if could give one verse of scripture that could give any hope that people aren going there give it to you but haven found it that fact that there is place called hell the fact that our god is god of holiness and must judge sin the fact that he has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we re responsible the fact that he has placed us in uni verse that has purpose and design behind it the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that god himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications as ve already mentioned if you are christian you must worn others its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out knowing therefore the terror of lord we persuade men if you haven accepted jesus are your savior you re taking an awful chance as say to the jehovah witnesses who no longer frequent my door if you are right and am wrong then will have lived good life and will die and cease to exist but if am right and you are wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation don mean to make fun at this point but its like dirty harry said you ve got to ask yourself do feel lucky well do you man got to know his limitations don be one of the whosoever wont because while was yet sinner he died for me there no greater love than this that man lay down his life for another rex

from rexlex fnal fnal gov subject re athiests and hell organization fnal ad net lines in article may geneva rutgers edu sun gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo writes between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this was precisely my point from theological bent those who lived immediately after the flood such as noah ham his son cush and his son nimrod had much stronger appreciation of divine wrath they also had stronger understanding of the true god in fact this immediacy was cause of hardship for some so much so that atlas who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders but this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting it is to put god and the strict spirituality of his law at distance and thus he became the elevator of the heavens this god made men able to feel as if heaven were afar off and as if either the god of heaven could not see through the dark cloud or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of his laws it is interesting to see that it was that was titled emancipator or deliverer or phoroneus it was nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind yet was worship for having given many benefits he was deliverer all right but not as we think of christ as deliverer one delivered from conscious feeling of god wrath the other actually performed delivery from gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians am not ready to consign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation don see the problem from the time of adam those who looked forward to the coming anointed one and put their faith in the fact that it was god who was to do the provision were accounted as righteous but up to the crucifixion their sins were only covered not taken away therefore the dispensation of the church views the accountability of sin the same but see it as completed action rom makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else it is possible to experience eternity in passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time understand what you re trying to convey but don think lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of say the church ruling with christ jn tells us what eternal life is exactly as you are correct that it is much more than non cessation of consciousness it was also standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost it depends upon your def of lost the elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world existentially we were all born lost but the righteous were in christ and therefore never assuredly lost it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people ideas of life after death maybe this summer could find time to put together paper on it simply have to buy more books for myself and these older books are very expensive either that or countless trips to the oriental museum mankind fell into mist and darkness and at the turning point of time new light entered into the world the light still grows and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under standing lies before us our new vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well couldn agree with you more our understanding of say eschatology is clearly clearer than that of say isaiah but that is not what was referring to at this point should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject the way you refer to it as doctrine puts modern intellectual coloring on it think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received no understand it as you have said this was my point am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they were passed on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience ah this is it this is the big question however would say again think that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it look at satan twist of god word when he coerced eve that is very interesting study the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality yes that is my point but it is two edged sword for some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed they were not known as mystery religions for no reason there was the public side of them and there was the private side that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side that is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light the mystery of iniquity that we find in the bible correlates to this think the primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately little by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion case in point today might be the masons just note that they too worshipped osiris in egypt who can be traced to nimrod the husband son on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today no disagree with you here gerry know what you re alluding to in that the church primarily the rcc did endorse aristotelian philosophy into their worldview but would disagree with you that it originated in greece if you are student of history you will come to see that much of what greece came to expound to the world as their original was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries the soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the egyptian religions as was the unity of god and also the trinity of god see if you can find wilkinson egyptians he really does number on what the greeks did to what they pilfered from the egyptians he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim not knocking aristotle or plato or any other greek thinker its just that there is nothing new under the sun indeed should also clarify that do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment after the end of single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out each age has its own focus of theology the early church struggled with the trinitarian formulation the reformation dealt with authority today eschatology has had much study the early creeds do not spell these things out in detail because they weren the topic of concern there was insufficient wisdom accumulated they didn have the exegetical tools that we have today also each age seems to have an air of revelation to it one age has well tended and cultivated garden in which particular doctrine is given growth it would be natural for the end of times to have the garden appropriate for the growth of eschatology wouldn it tangents never ending

from shellgate llo uu psi com larry overacker subject re the arrogance of christians organization shell oil lines in article apr athos rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes vbv eeap cwru edu virgilio dean velasco jr writes in article apr athos rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes are all truths also absolutes is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes the answer to both questions is yes perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition think you do similarly all truth is absolute indeed non absolute truth is contradiction in terms when is something absolute when it is always true obviously if truth is not always true then we have contradiction in terms agree with carol here determining absolutes is practically speaking waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative for example recently was asking some children the question what temperature does water boil at got the answer degrees consistently asked if they knew what scale and was told it just degrees any scale that what all thermometers say well that sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong it is not an absolute truth similarly scripture is full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point then religion easily becomes an intellectual head trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head covering in church deleted this was good example there may be an absolute truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which was having lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally the bible was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world such statement is terribly self contradictory let me put it to you this way if there are no absolutes shouldn we conclude that the statement there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously we have contradiction here don claim that there are no absolutes think there are very few though and determining absolutes is difficult agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since know can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me there is hardly consensus even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe can prove the existence of absolutes can only rely upon my experience also trust god revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite therefore we can comprehend the absolutes so don need them can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through which god is manifested to god creation so the reality can be that there are absolutes but it is of no practical importance it like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be swell who cares it doesn affect me in any practical useful way might as well believe that god has made lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on mars maybe god did so what is that going to have any effect on how deal with my neighbor or god whether or not go to this or that cafeteria for lunch no this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning christianity is true wonderful and sensible it appeals to reason since reason is an inner reflection of the logos of god explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to complex world note not claiming there is no place for authority that be silly there is world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally agressive good parents like god are authoritative many christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adults respond to this treatment larry overacker llo shell com lawrence overacker shell oil company information center

but thought share it with all of you anyway feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says may god richly bless those who read it what kind of question is that anyone who can read sees signs tracts books and bumper stickers that say god loves you isn that true it is true that god offers his love to the whole world as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john however god love is qualified the bible says the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverbs for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm but am not wicked am decent moral person surely the good have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad have done how can these verses apply to me by god standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as desperate sinner on his way to hell the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god romans the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah if am such wicked person in god sight what will god do to me the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in place called hell for fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains will heap mischiefs upon them will spend mine arrows upon them they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust deuteronomy oh come on now hell is not real is it surely things are not that bad indeed hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior the bible makes many references to hell indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matthew when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power thessalonians that is terrible why would god create hell hell is terrible and it exists because god created man to be accountable to god for his actions god perfect justice demands payment for sin for the wages of sin is death romans for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad corinthians but say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell indeed it does that is unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins that someone is god himself who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all isaiah but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed isaiah for delivered unto you first of all that which also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures corinthians for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him corinthians are you saying that if trust in christ as my substitute who was already punished for my sins then will not have to worry about hell anymore yes this is so if have believed in christ as my savior then it is as if have already stood before the judgment throne of god christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john but what does it mean to believe on him if agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior then am saved from going to hell believing on christ means whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible it means that we hang our whole lives on him it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon matthew repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord acts are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religions will their followers also go to hell yes indeed they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account able for our sins god demands that we pay for our sins other religions cannot provide substitute to bear the sins of their followers christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts jesus said am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness john now am desperate do not want to go to hell what can do you must remember that god is the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god as you see your hopeless condition as sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me sinner luke sirs what must do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved acts but how can believe on christ if know so little about him wonderfully god not only saves us through the lord jesus but he also gives us the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god ephesians god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith so if you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible which is the only word of god in this brochure all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs give heed to them with all your heart so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god romans but does this mean that have to surrender everything to god yes god wants us to come to him in total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in him the sacrifices of god are broken spirit broken and contrite heart god thou wilt not despise psalm because we are sinners we love our sins therefore we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins and if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us we know that our sins are sending us to hell unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities acts doesn the bible teach that must attend church regularly and be baptized will these save me if possible we should do these things but they will not save us no work of any kind can secure our salvation salvation is god sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas ure salvation is not of works lest any man should boast ephesians what else will happen at the end of the world those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord thessalonians what will happen to the earth at that time god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more but the day of the lord will come as thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness peter does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come yes the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations and then shall the end come matthew can we know how close to the end of the world we might be yes god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come as thief for the believers there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clues in the bible point to this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonians surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amos but that means judgment day is almost here yes it does god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning and jonah began to enter into the city day journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown jonah what did the people of nineveh do from the king on down they humbled themselves before god repented of their sins and cried to god for mercy but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not jonah did god hear their prayers yes god saved great many people of nineveh can still cry to god for mercy so that will not come into judg ment yes there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him hebrews in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him

paragraphs have read mr camping book compared it with what the bible actual ly says find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the future holds that have ever come across and agree with him that there is just too much data to ignore while none of us is guaranteed one more second of life and while we therefore should take these matters very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless now because in all

from wagner grace math uh edu david wagner subject re certainty and arrogance organization uh dept of math lines darren dr nancy sweetie kilroy gboro rowan edu writes darren in an earlier article explained that what many people find darren arrogant about christians is that some christians profess darren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines and darren in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources darren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own darren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect the point that darren raises is very lutheran viewpoint while reason is gift from god it is also infected by sin yet we do not reject reason entirely and neither think does darren we need reason as darren himself has pointed out to comprehend god revelation of himself in the bible but reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the word we need first and foremost faith for the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to god law nor can it do so romans luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelation sola scriptura but accepted the necessity of the use of reason with faith in comprehending that revelation yet luther also said regarding baptism but mad reason rushes forth and because baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as worthless large catechism fourth part baptism to make matters more complicated luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an absolutist ve seen him described as take no prisoners theologian we might conclude given these observations that luther was inconsistent or mad and surely at least some have come to that conclusion but it might be useful to recall that jesus was also called mad and peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against charge of drunkenness on pentecost so we as christians ought to be careful about rejecting luther or others as mad rather we should imitate the bereans who examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true acts the basis for the confidence with which luther peter paul and many others preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the holy spirit this is not faith divorced from reason but faith that guides informs and uses reason the spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly god does not want us to preach the message that think that jesus might have risen from the dead but rather know that my redeemer lives job the christian does not side with pilate in saying what is truth but rather follows christ who said in fact for this reason was born and for this came into the world to testify to the truth everyone on the side of truth listens to me john we can know the truth because god has promised us that we can know the truth jesus said if you hold to my teachings you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free john the proverbs urge us buy the truth and do not sell it pr the psalmist prayed do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth ps evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact in his mouth yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self glorification but if we present the truth as the teachings of scripture revealed by the spirit and not our own invention and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of scripture as luther did then we are not arrogant but humble we should humbly trust in god promise of truth just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness rexlex it is only because of god own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about thing darren but how far does that get you once god revelation stops darren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears agree that we must make distinction between the clear teachings of scripture and the products of our own reason even when such reasoning is based on scripture however think would draw the line of distinction more reasonably and less academically than you would darren for example let suppose that our modern bible translations darren include perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper darren and that jesus said exactly this is my body darren we ll presume that what he said was totally without error and darren absolutely true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stops speaking and people start darren interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean darren that literally or not we do not have any record that he darren elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con darren substantiation he didn say darren is almost at the point of making very lutheran statement about the lord supper the lutheran approach is to say that if jesus said this is my body then that is what we should believe other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in scripture recall that jesus words do not stand alone on this subject we also have paul words in corinthians in which he passed on to us what he received from the lord in particular he said for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lord death until he comes by these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the lord supper really is bread as well as the lord body as our senses in fact tell us does this prove that tran substantiation is false suppose someone could say that paul spoke metaphorically of the lord body as bread simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it but this thought is found nowhere in scripture so we reject it thus the primary reason for rejecting tran substantiation is not that we can prove it false but that it is simply not found in scripture side remark ve been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence is con substantiation but it has been non lutherans who have told me this we tend not to use the word almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion who need labels to compare catholic lutheran and reformed teachings on the lord supper but almost every church wants to call their own teaching real presence because that was the traditional teaching of the church end side remark darren when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning darren can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we darren are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe darren that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when darren the person you are talking to believes that you are either too darren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying darren to cover them up this is precisely why christians should not rely on in their witnessing it is far better to take the approach like to show you what scripture says you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not darren rexlex suggested that people read is there and he is not darren silent_ by francis schaeffer didn think very highly of darren it but think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many darren evangelical christians somebody else might like it though darren so don let my opinion stop you from reading it darren if someone is interested in my opinion suggest darren certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein as long as we re trading references like to suggest dr siegbert becker paperback the foolishness of god the place of reason in lutheran theology published by northwestern publishing house this book was based on becker doctoral thesis at the university of chicago david wagner not by might nor by power confessional lutheran but by my spirit says the lord almighty zechariah

from xray is rice edu kenneth dwayne ray subject re car stereo stolen organization rice university lines had the front panel of my car stereo stolen this weekend need to buy the front panel of sony xr car stereo if by any chance anyone has had the body of sony xr stolen and has an otherwise useless front panel would love to buy it from you if you know anyone who had removeable front panel car stereo stolen from them could you please forward this message to them thanks kris was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable front panels were to make the radio useless and thus discourage theft that is if the cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio originally costs or even sold at all then the above discouragement wouldn be so great personally would be unhappy if bought radio like that thinking that removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio value and the covers were sold by the company or other legitimate source cheaply if you cut here you ruin your monitor kenneth ray expert someone who knows more and more crc ocis about less and less and finally rice university knows everything about nothing
